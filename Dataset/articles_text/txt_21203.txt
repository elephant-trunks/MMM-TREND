With three phases down and four more to go in the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, social media continues to be full of misinformation surrounding the polls and those contesting. A video of Akhilesh Yadav has been making the rounds on social media with the claim that the Samajwadi Party leader is going to London on March 11, the day after counting.

Several social media users shared a video of a television interview where the interviewer is heard asking Yadav, “Are you going to London on 11th?” In reply, Yadav was heard saying, “Why shouldn’t I go to London.”

The India Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the viral clip was edited and presented with a misleading angle. In the original video, the anchor said to Yadav, “People are alleging, in the middle of all this, you had gone to London.”

Archived versions of posts with similar claims can be seen here and here.

AFWA PROBE

With the combination of reverse image and keyword searches, we found the original video of Akhilesh Yadav’s press conference shared on NDTV’s YouTube channel on June 23, 2021.

During the interview, there was a discussion on the Covid-19 conditions in Uttar Pradesh and the farmers’ agitation. At the 10.50-minute mark, one can hear the interviewer stating, “People are alleging, in the middle of all this, you had gone to London.”

In response, Yadav first stated, “You should know when I had gone to London.” He said that he expected the interviewer to have done their homework — to know when he had made the trip — if they were asking him questions on it. Yadav then clarified that he had gone to London to get his daughter admitted to college.

Hence, we can conclude that the claim along with this video is misleading. The video has been morphed and there is no mention of Yadav flying to London after the results of the Uttar Pradesh elections in this video.
