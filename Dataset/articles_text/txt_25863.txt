Two days after Will Smith’s ‘slapgate’ at the Oscars, an article allegedly written by journalist Rana Ayyub- who is in news after she was prevented to board a flight to London over an alleged money laundering case -titled ‘Will Smith Slapping Chris Rock is an Example of How Hinduism Makes One Violent’ is going viral on social media platforms with users believing it to be true. Newschecker found the viral article to be a satire.

Several Twitter users shared the article lashing out at Ayyub over her alleged write-up linking Hinduism and violence.

His lady @RanaAyyub crossed every possible limit to defame Hinduism.

A screenshot of the article is being widely shared on Facebook.

Despite winning the award for the Best Actor in a Leading Role, Will Smith’s ‘limelight’ moment at the recently held Academy Awards was when he slapped comedian Chris Rock for cracking a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith.

The Hinduism angle in the viral article can be traced down to 2019 when Smith had visited Haridwar to shoot for his Facebook Watch show “Will Smith’s Bucket List” and shared a series of pictures from his India tour on Instagram, in which he can be seen participating in ‘Hindu’ rituals with the caption, “My Grandmother used to say, “God Teaches through Experience”. Traveling to India & Experiencing the colors, people and natural beauty has awakened a new understanding of myself, my Art & the Truths of the world.”
