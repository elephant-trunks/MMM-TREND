Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a massive gathering in Hyderabad after a two-day National Executive Meeting of the Bharatiya Janata Party concluded on July 3, 2022.

In the above context, a video is circulating on social media, where BJP workers are seen distributing alcohol. The video is shared with a caption hinting that it is from the same event.

The video is shared with a caption that reads: “वाह मोदी जी, आपकी पार्टी ने तो तेलंगाना को भी गोवा बना दिया! क्या ऐश है! तेलंगाना मे भाजपा की दारू पार्टी” (English translation: Waah Modi Ji Waah! Your party has turned Telangana into Goa. What enjoyment! BJP’s alcohol party in Telangana.”)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did the fact-check, and found it to be misleading.

On doing a Google Reverse Image Search, we found the same video uploaded by Congress on December 20, 2021, with a caption: alcohol was distributed at a BJP rally in Uttar Pradesh.

We also found that the viral video was published by Dainik Jagran in December with a caption, claiming that Congress tweeted a video alleging BJP’s liquor distribution at a rally. However, the report warns that the website cannot verify the source of the video.

UP Tak also shared the video on December 21, 2021, and credited UP Congress’s Twitter handle. They, too, warned against the authenticity of the video.

Hence, we can ascertain that the viral video is old and has no relation to BJP’s recent rally in Hyderabad.
