A disturbing video of a blast at a CNG pump in Karachi, Pakistan is being circulated on social media with the false claim that it is linked to Tripura violence. Several people can be seen in the video in critical condition.

‘Ch Abid Hussain’ posted this video on Twitter along with the caption “Police department is one such department of our country which is always known for its justice which punishes the oppressors and gives justice to the oppressors, but the dastardly acts of #Tripura police is a shame to the police department of the whole country. It’s a matter of shame. #ShameOnTripuraPolice”

Very sad and appalling, I’ve been there twice before. Safety protocols should be in place at all CNG/Petrol pumps. Non technical ppl are monitoring these bomb stations in #Karachi”

Apart from this, on a keyword search, we found that a portion of the viral clip has been played in the news bulletin of Pakistani news channels ’92 News HD Plus, Aaj News and Geo TV’. Along with this, information about the incident was also given. The Express Tribune‘s report published on October 30, 2021, described the incident as “at least four people were killed on Friday in an explosion ‘triggered by short-circuiting’ at a fuel station in the Nazimabad area of ​​Karachi. Six including two women were injured. Three people died on the spot as a result of the blast, while another lost his life on the way to the hospital. The six injured are undergoing treatment.”

Therefore, this claim is misleading and is being falsely linked to Tripura violence.
