Spread the truth:

Is that Kejriwal on the Wall ? It does rhyme but is not true, it’s actually Kejriwal by photoshop which doesn’t rhyme at all.

It’s a clear proof that Photoshop is the most secular entity, it welcomes all with open hands, any religion, any political party.

And also a proof the “Bhakts” are omnipresent, they don’t belong to a religion or a political party.

The one who believed in this photo and shared it has a clear absence of Common Sense.

– how is it possible ?

– why media didn’t show it?

– why PM didn’t notice ?
