Spread the truth:

A Post on a Facebook page by name “Yogi Sarkar” liked by more than 3 Lakh people had 8000 shares. The image shows Congress president Rahul Gandhi watching a photo of a girl on mobile wearing red lingerie which might mean porn wasn’t the right word to be used in the title of this article 😉

Truth:

The image is edited, Photoshopped. He was actually counting currency notes which has been replaces by mobile with such image

As you can see below, only the mobile part has noise, rest of the photo is smooth.

Real Photo –

The video is from Nov 2016
