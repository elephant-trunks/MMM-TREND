Several rumors have been spread on social media by the usual propagandists alleging that the Uttar Pradesh government has framed new laws for the retention of a Ration card, asking some individuals to surrender their cards with specific recommendations.

International media were claiming that 80cr people in India take food from the government for the survival and rated us very badly in a poor index.

According to rumours, the Uttar Pradesh government issued directives stating that anyone with a motorcycle, a poultry farm, a dairy, any piece of land, or a house in an urban locality is no longer eligible for ration cards. They were accordingly instructed to return the ration card, and if they do not, the market value of the food grains allocated to them would be recovered from them subsequently.

However, The Uttar Pradesh government has stated that no fresh orders relating to the surrender or cancellation of ration cards had been issued by the government. It further stated that no such order has been issued, neither by the government nor by the respective departments.
