A video of Nighat Abbass, who describes herself as a media panelist for the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) Delhi wing, is viral on social media with misleading claims.



The video shows Abbass in a burqa chanting 'Azadi' or freedom, from various opposition party leaders.

The clip is viral on right-wing Facebook pages which make no mention in their posts that Abbass is affiliated with the party.



The Hindi caption accompanying the video translates to: "a new thing just happened, these people want freedom from Rahul Gandhi. Help shall be provided."

(Translated from Hindi: अबे नई चीज हो गई राहुल गांधी से आजादी चाहिए इन लोगों को 😂😂😂 इनकी मदद की जाए)

In the video, Abbass can be seen saying, "Bharat mata ki Jai, we will take freedom, freedom from Rahul Gandhi, freedom from Akhilesh, freedom from Maya [Mayavati] aunty, freedom from Mamata didi..."

(Translated from Hindi: भारत माता की जय, हम लेके रहेंगे आज़ादी, हम मिलकर लेंगे आज़ादी, राहुल गाँधी से आज़ादी, अखिलेश [यादव] से लेंगे आज़ादी, माया [मायावती] बुआ से आज़ादी, ममता दीदी से आज़ादी...)
