A terrifying video of massive boulders tumbling down a hill and some crashing into a bridge is being widely shared by social media users in Pakistan with the claim that the landslide took place in the northern part of their country.

A Facebook user shared the video with the caption, “Astaghfirullah Rabbi Wa Atubo Eleh. Appalling massive landslide view in northern Pakistan. May Allah Kareem protect us all, from such catastrophic incidents. Ameen.”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The landslide seen in the video took place on July 25, 2021, in Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh.

Reverse-searching key frames of the viral video, we found it in a Twitter post by “DD News”.

The same video was also used in reports by “Reuters” “The Times of India” and “Hindustan Times”.

Nine tourists had lost their lives and three were injured seriously after heavy boulders fell on their tempo traveler during a landslide. The incident took place on July 25 in Kinnaur, Himachal Pradesh.

The viral video is related to the same unfortunate incident, which was covered widely by national and international media.

However, a landslide had indeed occurred in a coal mine in Pakistan’s Balochistan province on July 24, 2021. Four workers had lost their lives in the incident.

Evidently, a landslide that occurred in Himachal Pradesh is being falsely linked to Pakistan.
