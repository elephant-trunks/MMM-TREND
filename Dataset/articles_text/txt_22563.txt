A disturbing image of a man falling from the top of a sky-high tower has gone viral on social media. It is being claimed as a live suicide from Dubai’s Burj Khalifa.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false. We found that the viral image has been photoshopped, and it has got no link with Burj Khalifa in Dubai.

Facebook page PK Entertainment’ posted the misleading photo with the caption: In Dubai Burj Khalifa live suicide.

The archived version of the post can be seen here.

We reverse-searched the viral image and found that the picture is not of Dubai’s Burj Khalifa but it is Egypt’s Cairo Tower.

In the viral image, it can be seen that there is an unusual gap between the man and the tower. If a man jumps from a tower, there can’t be so much gap. Also, the size of the falling man is comparatively bigger in front of the tower.

We then searched with keywords related to the suicide incident at Egypt's Cairo Tower. We found a report published on December 2, 2019, by Middle East Monitor.

According to the report, 20-year-old Nader Mohammad, who was going through a psychological crisis, jumped from the top of the Cairo Tower. Nader had informed a friend that he intended to commit suicide.

There was no such picture of Nader jumping from the Cairo Tower. Hence, it is clear that the viral picture has been photoshopped.
