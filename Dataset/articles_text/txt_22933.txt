A photograph of Narendra Modi is being extensively circulated on social media, showing the prime minister waving a green flag used during religious functions in Islam. The post doesn’t explicitly mention what flag Modi was holding, however, the comment with the picture seems to suggest that the PM was waving an Islamic flag.

India Today’s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the image is morphed. The original photo is of PM Modi waving a plain green flag while inaugurating a train in Assam.

The viral photo was posted by Facebook page Bhashan Ya Rashan’ on January 29.

The picture has received more than 8,500 reactions and was shared by around 1,200 users. The flag in the picture features a crescent moon and a star resembling an Islamic flag.

The archival version of the post can be seen here.

The Hindi translation of the comment reads: He is showing his reality now. Fans, go die in shame.

The photo was actually clicked during the inauguration of the Bogibeel Bridge in Assam on December 25 last year. The prime minister was waving off the green flag while launching a train on the longest railroad bridge in the country.

Here’s the original image posted by Press Information Bureau from the event.

The original photo has a plain green flag in the hands of PM Modi, confirming that the crescent moon and star were superimposed on the misleading post.

This fake information was pointed out by a Twitter user on Thursday.

Facebook Page Sponsored by Congress, Bhashan Ya Rashan is not only posting photoshopped pic but also promoting that photoshopped pic.@DelhiPolice @Uppolice @HMOIndia pic.twitter.com/M4n6YDlkA5 Shashank (@pokershash) February 21, 2019



Hence, the claim that PM Modi waving off an Islamic flag is totally false.
