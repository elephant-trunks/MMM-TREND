A powerful blast in Pakistan's financial capital Karachi on Saturday killed 17 people and injured many. Police said the blast could have been triggered by a gas explosion in a sewage drain located underneath a private bank.

On social media, a video of a huge explosion is circulating as visuals of the Karachi blast.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the post to be misleading. This is the video of the August 2020 explosion in Beirut, Lebanon.

With the help of keywords, we found many media reports saying the viral video. BBC reports said the blast occurred at Beirut port on August 4, 2020, due to a fire that triggered the detonation of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely in a port warehouse.

That blast killed 219 people and injured thousands. The explosion was so massive that it was heard 240 km away on the island of Cyprus on the eastern Mediterranean. The blast caused severe damage to Beirut as many buildings around the port were destroyed. We found other videos of the blast too.

BREAKING NEWS: At least eight people have died so far and scores of others were reportedly injured in a blast in Karachi's Shershah Paracha Chowk area on Saturday.

Coming to the Karachi blast, Pakistan-based media outlet "The Express Tribune" on December 18 had tweeted CCTV footage of the incident.

Several unverified videos and images have been doing the rounds on social media since the explosion in Karachi. AFWA has debunked some of them, as can be seen here and here.

Hence, it can be concluded that an old video from Beirut has been passed off as the Karachi blast.
