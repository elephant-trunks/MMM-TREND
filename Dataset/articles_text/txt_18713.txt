In the video, a man can be seen trapping an alligator, which had wandered into a residential area, using a thrash bin.

Fact-Check On Sikh Man Capturing Crocodile



We searched for news reports on the incident using the keywords "Florida crocodile thrash bin" and found multiple reports.

CNN affiliate WESH spoke to the man in the video and identified him as Eugene Bozzi, a US military veteran from Florida.

It is clear from the video interview that Bozzi is not a Sikh man of Indian origin but rather an African-American man.







In the video, Bozzi, is wearing a durag, a cloth cap traditionally worn by African-American men.

It is likely that Bozzi's durag was misidentified as a Patka, a cloth cap worn by Sikhs under their turban.
