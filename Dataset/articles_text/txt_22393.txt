A crude bomb explosion at the Mog Bazaar intersection in Dhaka has resulted in the death of a 21-year-old youth named Siyam. The blast occurred on Wednesday evening when an explosive was hurled from a flyover, landing near the Freedom Fighters Memorial. Police have cordoned off the area and launched an investigation into the motive and unidentified attackers. In a separate incident, the historic Madhur Canteen at Dhaka University was vandalised by a man who threw furniture inside the premises. The report highlights that 'the blast occurred beneath the flyover... an area that is usually crowded during evening hours.' Security has been tightened across the area following these violent incidents.
