A poster of a warrior on horseback, sword drawn, is circulating on social media with the claim that it is Tipu Sultan. The picture was mostly shared on November 20, believed to be the birth anniversary of the 18th century Mysore ruler.

"Remembering 'The Tiger of Mysore', #TipuSultan who fought valiantly against British colonialism, on his birth anniversary today," reads the accompanying caption.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral picture is morphed. The original picture is of Chhatrapati Shivaji with his horse.

Several netizens have pointed out that the viral image is morphed and actually of Chhatrapati Shivaji.

Taking this as a clue, with the help of TinEye reverse image search, we found that the original picture has been available on the Internet since 2017as a wallpaper of Chhatrapati Shivaji.

The original poster has been up for sale on several e-commerce websites such as Amazon, Flipkart and Jemiz for a long time.

Comparing the original and viral images, one can easily figure out that the latter is morphed, and Chhatrapati Shivaji's face has been replaced with that of Tipu Sultan. The colour of the fort in the background has also been changed.

In 2015, the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in Karnataka began observing the birth anniversary of Tipu Sultan on November 20, which led to a lot of controversies.

Many in India revere Tipu Sultan, remembered for his battles against the British and as a pioneer of rocket artillery. However, he is also hated by some sections for alleged atrocities against Hindus.

However, it is clear that the viral poster is not of Tipu Sultan but the great Maratha Chhatrapati Shivaji.
