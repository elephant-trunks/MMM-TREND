A few weeks ago, a Facebook page named ‘Amethi Rae Bareli ki Kahani’ shared a video that shows Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath claiming that he is actually a God. The video uploaded by the Facebook page soon went viral, and it has already racked up more than 96,000 views and 5,878 shares as of now.

Many people who watched the video also started trolling the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, and they argued that Yogi Adityanath should be confined in a psychiatric hospital soon. Some other people claimed that Yogi is trying to emerge as a self-proclaimed Godman.

Is this video authentic? Did Yogi Adityanath ever say that he is a god? Let us check out.

Upon our research, we came to know that the video uploaded by the Facebook page has been intentionally edited to tarnish the image of Yogi Adityanath in front of the general public. In reality, when the interviewer asked whether Yogi is a God, the Chief Minister replied that he is not.

The manipulated video has been edited in such a way that it will make the viewers think that Yogi has claimed himself as God. Watching the video more carefully revealed that the word ‘Yes’ has been inserted just some milliseconds after the interviewer finished his question. It should be also noted that there is a small video jump between the interviewer’s question and Yogi’s answer which clearly indicates that the video is fabricated.

After doing a thorough investigation, we came to know that the original interview was actually uploaded to YouTube on February 28, 2017. The interview was given by the Chief Minister for ABP, and it was actually more than 27 minutes in length. However, the newly released clip is just 17 seconds long, with manipulation done in the 13th and the 14th second.

Conclusion: The story is misleading based on a video clipping technique. Our rating of this news is ??? (Misrepresentation).
