As Delhi goes to polls on February 8, a list of names is going viral on social media with the claim that the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has announced its first list of candidates. Incidentally, with 21 out of the 27 names in the list being Muslims, there’s a communal spin to the claim.

The claim in Hindi along with the viral post translates to, This is the Aam Aadmi Party’s first list of 27 candidates for the Delhi assembly elections, of which 21 are Muslims. Delhiites, be careful, else it won’t be long before Delhi becomes another Kashmir and you’ll put an axe on your own feet. Seelampur, Okhla, Shaheen Bagh, Jasola, Nangloi, Shahbad Dairy and Khureji are prepared to vote; development and honesty won’t matter.

AFWA probe

To verify the claim along with the viral post, we contacted AAP’s IT cell head Ankit Lal, who told us that the viral list is fake. Ankit Lal said the party has not announced its candidates yet and may do so in the coming week. Media reports also suggest that AAP may announce its first list on January 14.

We also ran a search on the Internet with appropriate keywords but could not find any media report confirming the viral claim. Being the ruling party in Delhi, if AAP makes any such announcement, it will make headlines.

Hence, it is clear that the viral list is fake and not the actual list of AAP candidates for the upcoming Delhi assembly elections 2020.
