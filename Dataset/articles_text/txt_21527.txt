"This woman in Afghanistan was killed by Taliban for not wearing the proper cloth," reads the caption along with the video.

Old video resurfaces

Reverse-searching keyframes from the video, we found it on multiple news websites. According to a "Daily Mail" report dated January 15, 2015, Al-Qaeda fighters publicly shot and killed a woman accused of adultery.

The incident took place at Maarat al-Numan in northwestern Syria. Even ISIS

had reportedly condemned the killing.

CNN had also covered the incident. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said in its report that the Al-Qaeda's Syria wing, Al-Nusra Front, executed the woman outside the city of Idlib.

The killers had even rejected the woman's request to see her children before she died.

Therefore, it is clear that though the Taliban has been committing gross human rights abuses in Afghanistan, the viral video is six years old and from Syria.
