The same image was viral in August, 2020, with a similar claim. BOOM ran a reverse image search on the photo which led us to the Shutterstock website carrying the same image. A Chinese caption with the photo translates to 'Interior of the Green Mosque (Yesil Camii) in Bursa, Turkey, on March 31th, 2016'. The Green Mosque was built between 1415 and 1419 in Bursa, Turkey. The mosque comprises mausoleum (tomb) , madrasa, cultivation and Turkish baths.
