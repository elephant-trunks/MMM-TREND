the protesrors against CAA slapping Hindu GOD photos with sandals and burnt

Why the Religion and God is coming into their protest? I feel it is the indication of their hatred against Hinduism not CAA

As an Hindu why should I tolerate such hatred protests under Secularism?

It all shows that instead of Rohingya, the Indian secular muslim are dangerous to nation

Does JAI BHIM / BABA SAHEEB taught them to hate Hindus in their own land?
