We started the investigation by watching these videos closely and noticed a sign board with “Al Bahri” written on it.

After that we searched “Al Bahri Road” on Google and we came to know that this road is in Muscat, the capital of Oman.

After this we searched for this video on YouTube with the help of the keywords “Al Bahri Road Oman Lahar”. In the result, we got the video uploaded on 30th October 2019. The title of this video reads, “Latest Kyarr Cyclone II Mathra Corniche Cyclone 2019 II Muscat/Oman II shahibond II”

This video contains footage that is being shared on social media in the form of short clips. It is from a place on the Al-Bahri road called “Mathra Corniche, which is an area with greater expansion of the sea shore.
