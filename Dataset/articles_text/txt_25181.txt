The same video has been shared widely on Whatsapp chats and groups as well.

Truth

The viral video is fake. Upon doing reverse image search it was found that the video was photoshopped. The actual video is of PM Narendra Modi watching the live telecast of the launch of Chandrayaan-2 by ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation). In the viral video that has been extensively shared, real visuals of the launch of Chandrayaan2 were edited and replaced by visuals from the TV series, Ramayana.

This is not the first time that the same video is being used to fool the people. Few months back the same video was edited and circulated with the claim that PM Modi was clapping hands while watching P. Chidambaram being arrested on screen.

The real video tweeted by ANI is being attached below to prove the fact that the claim is fake.
