American pop star Madonna has always been a sensation among music aficionados. But netizens recently went overboard in posting a video on social media, with the claim that the vocalist seen recording Hanuman Chalisa is Madonna.

Facebook user 'Manohar Pv' posted the five minute-54 second video with the caption: "MODIFICATION..? Times are indeed changing! Madonna sings Hanuman Chalisa."

India Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the vocalist in the viral video singing Hanuman Chalisa is not Madonna.

Facebook users 'Vishnu Gupta' and 'Global Hindus' have also uploaded the video with similar claims.

The video is being widely circulated on other social media platforms, including Twitter.

Under the comments sections of one of the posts, a user Preetesh Singh pointed out that the singer is not Madonna and it is a band called 'Shanti People'. We searched on the Internet and found the same video on the official YouTube channel of Shanti People that the band posted on May 26, 2015. It also mentioned the name of the singer as Uma Devi.



As per the details available on the official website of the band, Shanti People is a music band that mixes ancient Vedic mantras with contemporary electronic dance music. Uma Devi is the female vocalist of the band. According to her Facebook account, she is from Russia and lives in Ukraine.
