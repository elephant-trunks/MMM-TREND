The Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to an influx of posts supposedly depicting Ukrainians overcome with emotion while trying to deal with the war. One such post featured the photo of an old man with his cat in front of a charred house.

“Bombs & bullets will never break our bond with our companion animals #StandWithUkraine,” read one such caption on Twitter. Similar posts were shared on Facebook as well.

The India Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that this photo was taken in 2018 in Turkey. An emotional Ali Mese, 83, from Bolu, Turkey, was photographed after his house was devastated in a fire.

With the help of reverse image search, we found the photo was shared on the internet as early as 2018.

We found this image in a TRT World news report on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoan voting for the Anadolu Agency's Photos of the Year awards. The viral photo, titled “Ali and his cat,” was selected among the best photos of the Turkish news agency. The article was published in December 2018.

We found more details about this photo on several Turkish news websites. According to reports, the name of the old man in the photo is Ali Mese.

Mese, 83, accidentally set his house on fire while trying to ignite a stove with gasoline in the Mudurnu district of the Bolu province in Turkey in January 2018. The old man was photographed in an emotional state after the firefighters rescued his pet from his charred house.

Thus, we conclude that this picture of an old man and his cat is not from Ukraine but Turkey and it is over five years old.
