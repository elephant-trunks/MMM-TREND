Yesterday we witnessed the first round of the Uttar Pradesh general assembly elections in 11 districts. Meanwhile, a video of Shivraj Chouhan got viral claiming that he said there are full chances of BJP winning in Uttar Pradesh but chances in Uttarakhand are null.

Uttarakhand Congress tweets, “After campaigning from Uttarakhand, Chief Minister @ChouhanShivraj of Madhya Pradesh told the reality of BJP in Uttarakhand, said BJP has gone from Uttarakhand. #उत्तराखंड_से_भाजपा_तो_गई

Harish Rawat, Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, also tweeted that the CM of Madhya Pradesh said that BJP stands no chance in Uttarakhand.

Fact check

After searching for the ground reality of the video and the claim, we got an article from NBT Times that writes in the viral video Shivraj Chauhan was talking to the journalist and said that BJP is in UP as well Uttarakhand. There is competition yet BJP can make it through. After that, he also requested the boy to not record the video.

Zee TV also wrote how Madhya Pradesh, CM claimed about BJP is alive in Uttarakhand as well.

Conclusion- Hence proving that the claim over Shivraj Chauhan is misleading.

Claim Review: Shivraj Chauhan carry doubt over BJP’s victory in Uttarakhand

Claim by: Uttarakhand Congress, Harish Rawat
