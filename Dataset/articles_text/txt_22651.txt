Is former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh and senior BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan faking fracture in his hand? A collage of two photographs of Chouhan is doing the rounds on social media.

The claim

In the first photo, one can see a blue plaster on his left hand, whereas in the second image, the same plaster can be seen on his right hand. It is being claimed that the images are from the same day and he is faking his injury. Chouhan is in different attire in both the pictures.

The probe

India Today’s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the first image of the collage is actually flipped. Chouhan had surgery on his right hand recently.

The archived version of the post can be seen here.

Facebook Page Azamgarh Express’ shared the collage with the caption that roughly translates: One photo was clicked in the morning and another was taken in the evening. Shivraj Singh changed his fracture with his clothes. The post has already been shared more than 1,700 times at the last count.

To find out the truth, we cropped the first image and did a reverse search on it. We found the full picture which is actually a selfie taken at some event.

It is not hard to notice that the image is flipped. One can see that the men in the photograph have buttons of their shirts on the left side. Usually, men’s shirts have buttons on the right side.

We also found the latest images and videos of Chouhan on his official Twitter handle. The blue bandage can be seen on his right hand in all those images and videos. The former MP CM had hand surgery just last week.

State president of Maharashtra BJP, Rakesh Singh, shared the images from Jhabua on September 30. Chouhan along with Singh and others had campaigned for BJP candidate Bhanu Bhuriya for the Jhabua Assembly bypolls. Chouhan can be seen in the same clothes as in the viral image.

Hence, it is clear that the viral photo has been flipped to mislead people.
