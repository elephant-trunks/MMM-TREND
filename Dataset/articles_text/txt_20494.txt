Recently, assembly elections were held in five states. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is going to form its government again in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Manipur, and Goa. However, in Punjab the party got disappointment. Meanwhile, a video is becoming massively viral on social media. In which some people are brutally beating a person by shouting Jai Shri Ram. Further, in the video police are rescuing the bleeding youth.

Moreover, sharing this video on Twitter, the user gave a caption, “Ramraj has started, now the people of OBC SC ST who have voted for BJP, see what is going to happen, how the people of Bahujan Samaj are being killed, this is yesterday’s incident, and say Jai Shri Ram.”

Similarly, many other users on Facebook and Twitter shared this video in large numbers.

Fact Check:

To verify the above claim, we took the help of the InVid tool by converting the video into different keyframes and doing a google reverse image search in each keyframe. Then, we found a news report from TV 9 Hindi in this regard. A screenshot of the viral video was used in this report.

Further, according to the report this incident is of Shivaji Chowk in Bhabua, Bihar. There was an incident of assault with the accused son of the ward member. In the video, a mob is seen thrashing the accused man while chanting ‘Jai Shri Ram.’

Apart from this, the UP Police also confirmed that the viral video is not related to Uttar Pradesh but to the police station Bhabua, District Kaimur, Bihar.

Conclusion:

Hence, the claim of BJP workers beating up the youth after winning the elections is misleading.
