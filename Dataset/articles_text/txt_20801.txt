Who did this ? 🤣🤣 Live pic from Vatican City !? #ModiInRome pic.twitter.com/jkbt2KtIof — Aditya Singh (@Beingadiisingh) October 30, 2021

Fact-Check:

We searched for news reports of the event and could not find any mention of Modi dressing up as a Catholic Priest. Moreover, after reverse searching the image we found pictures of the Pope dressed in the exact same outfit. Leading us to believe that the image is photoshopped.

Therefore, this claim is fake.
