Soon after Rahul Gandhi's "Surender Modi" jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Galwan Valley conflict with China, a picture of former PM late Indira Gandhi addressing soldiers in the backdrop of a mountain range has gone viral on social media.

The claim along with the black-and-white picture, which has been shared by several social media profiles, including the verified Twitter handle of Uttar Pradesh Congress, claims that Indira Gandhi is seen here addressing soldiers at Galwan Valley.

Twitter handles such as "UP Congress", "Spirit of Congress" and "Indira Gandhi" tweeted the picture with the same claim. These tweets have gone viral.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The viral picture was published by news agency "Press Trust of India" in 1971 in Leh, which is around 220 kilometres from the conflict zone of Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh.

The same picture was retweeted by the verified Twitter handle of "Delhi Congress" and Congress leader "Alka Lamba". Several verified Facebook pages such as "Indian National Congress - Uttar Pradesh" and "U.P East Youth Congress" have posted the same content. The post has gone viral on Facebook too.

Using reverse image search, we found the picture in an article on Indira Gandhi on the website "art-sheep.com". The caption under the picture says, "One of the rare pictures of former Prime Minister late Indira Gandhi addressing jawans in Leh in 1971."

We looked for the original source of this picture and found it in PTI's archive section. According to PTI, this picture was taken in Leh in 1971. The news agency has given the picture courtesy to DPR (Defence).

Hence, it is clear that the viral picture of former PM late Indira Gandhi addressing soldiers is not from Galwan Valley but Leh, which is more than 200 kilometres from the flashpoint.
