Fact

We conducted reverse image search on the keyframes of the viral video along with keywords “BBC Newsnight interview 1999” on Google which led us to a tweet by British Comic Michael Spicer, dated January 3, 2022. The tweet carried the same video with the caption “David Bowie Predicts the Impact of the Internet on Newsnight (1999).” Notably, Spicer is known for his satirical and parody videos.

A user @Stephwolfe101 shared the YouTube link to the “real” 1999 David Bowie interview.

On analysing the video, and comparing the man seen in the viral video with pictures of both Mick Jagger and David Bowie, we could conclude that the viral clip was in fact a spoof created by Spicer, who can be seen dressed up like Bowie from the 1999 interview. The comic had interspersed clips from David Bowie’s original interview with BBC Newsnight in 1999.

Notably, the same video had gone viral in January 2022, claiming to show David Bowie predicting the impact of the internet in a 1999 interview. Newschecker had debunked it then as well. You can read it here.

Result: Satire
