Spread the truth:

Imran Khan didn’t say this. #Photoshopped

Someone made this for humor but people seem to have taken it seriously LOL. A photo is getting viral which shows Imran Khan is holding a banner which says “Proud of Narendra Modi and Indian Army for screwing us. We deserve this”

This is a fake photoshopped photo

The original photo is five years old I.e. 2012 I.e. before Modi Ji Become PM. –

The Tribute

Exactly a year after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) took out a large rally in the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) stronghold of Lahore, the party’s supporters initiated the#30OctPTIDay trend in remembrance of the day, which most of them termed on Twitter as “historic”.

The rally, which roped in around 45,000 PTI supporters, caused a stir in the political scene and all rallies which followed later started concentrating on attracting large number of participants.
