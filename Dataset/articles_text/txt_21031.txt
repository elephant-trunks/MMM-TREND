Amid talk of implementing a Uniform Civil Code by some Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states (like Uttar Pradesh), and the All India Muslim Personal Law Board calling it an “anti-constitutional move”, social media has seen a flurry of posts on UCC, either for or against.

Of these was a photo of a Muslim man riding a two-wheeler along with five children and a woman in a burqa. The photo was shared by many with captions that claimed that without the Uniform Civil Code in India, large Muslim families like this one will reap all the benefits of taxpayers’ money.

The text in the photo read, “Please pay your taxes on time to ensure this family gets all benefits in time.” It was shared on Twitter and Facebook along with the hashtags #UniformCivilCode, #OneNationOneLaw.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that this photo was not from India, but from Bangladesh, and has been on the internet since 2017, at least.

The viral posts are archived here and here.

AFWA PROBE

A reverse image search of the photo revealed it has been on the internet since 2017, at least. We found a Facebook Page named “Electric Bikers Association Bangladesh” that shared the image on December 7, 2017.

In this photo, we noticed a signboard in the background that said in Bengali “Hanif Enterprise, Bhatiapara-Dhaka-Chattogram.” The board also contained a photo of a bus in the bottom-right corner.

When we searched for “Hanif Enterprise”, we found a Facebook Page of the same, a private bus service in Bangladesh that operated in several locations across Chittagong and Dhaka.

We also found that that photo went viral in 2020 alongside hashtags like #WeWantPopulationControlLaw. This was debunked by fact-checkers at the time.

Thus, we concluded that a photo of a Muslim family from Bangladesh (that’s been online since 2017 at least) was used to bolster arguments favouring the implementation of a Uniform Civil Code.
