Fact Check Methodology

At first we ran a Google search with relevant keywords and looked for any image or video of Hurricane Shaheen that ravaged through parts of the middle east recently. But we failed to find anything that looks like the viral video.

Following that we ran another combination of relevant keywords and then found an article which states that the video is actually a digital artwork by artist Brent Shavnore published on May 19, 2019.
