Pictures of the magnificient Mehrangarh Fort in Rajasthan's Jodhpur district are doing rounds on social media with the claim that one can see the entire Pakistan from here.

The photos of the fort along with the claim were shared by Amar Ujala, a leading Hindi national daily, which has a whopping 7.5 million followers on Facebook.

India Today Fact Check found the claim to be completely false.

Here is the archived version of the story.

The post was shared by more than 1,200 Facebook users, and received over 17,000 likes.

For a fort which is 125 metre above the sea level, it is practically impossible to see objects which are located more than 200 kilometre away unless it is a mountain range.

Applying the same logic, one should be able to see parts of Pune from Imperial Towers in Mumbai which is double the height of the Mehrangarh Fort, but that's again impossible.

Earlier too, a similar claim was made by another reputed news organisation, Dainik Bhaskar.

The article was published in 2015.

It also claimed that Pakistan is visible from the Mehrangarh Fort. The article also said

there is a fort in Pakistan that looks exactly like the Mehrangarh Fort.

India Today Fact Check found that it is the Derawar Fort in Bahawalpur district of Pakistan's Punjab which resembles the Kishangarh Fort in Jaisalmer, and not the Mehrangarh Fort.

The claims about the Mehrangarh Fort made by Amar Ujala as well as Dainik Bhaskar in the past are false.
