A picture is getting viral over social media which has a claim that Ukraine invaded Iraq in 2003.

Fact check

After doing the reverse image search, we found that the picture was photoshopped, the original image was from the article of 2013 when Iraq reiterates its commitment to pay Kuwait compensation. In the original picture, there’s no such print of a Ukrainian emblem. Hence proving that the image is photoshopped and most importantly the US, UK and Poland were the ones who invaded Iraq in 2003 and not Ukraine.

Conclusion: the image is photoshopped and the claim is misleading.
