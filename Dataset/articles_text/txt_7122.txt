A post is being widely shared on social media claiming that the sound of cash being dispensed at an ATM is fake. The post claims that the sound is not real, but is produced by a small speaker inside the ATM. Let us fact-check the claim made in the post.

Claim: The sound of cash being dispensed at an ATM is fake. Fact: Majorly, the sound of cash dispensed comes from the working of motors and machines inside the ATMs; there is no special speaker to create an artificial sound. However, there can be a possibility of designing an ATM which can artificially make sounds of cash dispensed. Hence, the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.

The claim is being shared online for a long time now. It is being shared on social media at least since 2014.

When we searched online about the claim that the sound of cash being dispensed at an ATM is fake, we found a YouTube video which explains the functioning of an ATM by showing the insides of it. The YouTuber shows the working of the machine while some supposed cash was being dispensed. It can be seen in the video that the sound comes from the motors and machines inside the ATM. There was no special speaker inside the ATM.

Several people who claim to have serviced ATMs refuted the viral claim, which can be seen here and here. However, there can be a possibility of designing an ATM which can artificially make sounds of cash dispensed.

To sum it up, the statement, ‘the sound of cash being dispensed at an ATM is fake’ is misleading.
