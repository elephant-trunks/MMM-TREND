Spread the truth:

Photoshop Partiality with Hardik Patel caught ! The right one didn’t photo-shop ‘chakhna’, ‘cigarette’, nor even a glass.

It’s not fair. How can a photo-shopper be a Miser ? Rather should have photo-shopped the costliest alcohol in the world, a cigar may be.

The guy who photo-shopped the left image seems to have big heart, he did photoshop a glass, a cigarette and stuff to eat with liquor.

This photo is viral claiming Hardik Patel is drinking as if it’s a big Sin and the photo-shoppers don’t commit LOL.

Right one Photo-shopped by someone with big heart.



Left one, photo-shopped by a Miser



Same goes with this image, this has also been photoshopped, you can see, all the bottles are same and both glasses are same too, same light reflection and physics also tells us if the bottles and glasses are vertical on table or not.
