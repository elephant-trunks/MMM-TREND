Amid the ongoing pre-monsoon floods and landslides in Assam, social media too has been inundated with videos and photos of the massive destruction. Amid this, a video of a man sleeping on a mattress while floating on muddy waters was widely shared with the claim that it was from Assam.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found this video was not from Assam, or even from India. It was shot during a January 2021 flood in Johor Bahru, Malaysia.

A reverse image search of the video's frames revealed that it has been on the internet since 2021 at least.

On January 13, 2021, Malay-language news website mStar reported on the viral video. Per the report, the man seen in the viral video was Muhamad Faris Sulaiman from Johor Bahru, Malaysia.

Sulaiman shared the video on January 10, 2021, on Instagram with the caption: “If I’m tired, I can sleep anywhere.” The video went viral at the time as well. The video was also later shared by mStar on its Instagram page .

In January 2021, several parts of Malaysia saw floods. Speaking about the video, Sulaiman told mStar that he made it because his home was flooded and he wanted to vent his frustrations. He said that his mother shot the video. He also said that he was happy to have entertained others while they faced the natural disaster.

As per news reports, Assam State Disaster Management Authority officials said that two people died in southern Assam's Cachar district amid floods, while five died earlier in landslides in Dima Hasao and Lakhimpur districts.

Presently, 20 districts in the state are experiencing floods. However, this viral video undoubtedly is not from Assam.
