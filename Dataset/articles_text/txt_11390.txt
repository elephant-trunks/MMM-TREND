We started the investigation by contacting Roopak Kumar, Superintendent of Bhagalpur Central Jail in Bihar. He told us that “the viral video on social media is actually that of a mock drill in Bhagalpur Jail. This mock drill was conducted by the Bihar Police on 10th or 11th April. The purpose of this mock drill was to demonstrate how to treat and care for coronavirus infected patients. No prisoner or policeman in the jail is infected with coronavirus.”

The video was aired on 11th April 2020 from a YouTube channel called Nation India. According to this news, this video from a mock drill in Bhagalpur Central Jail, Bihar. The title of this video reads, “Corona mock drill in Bihar’s Bhagalpur Central Jail, A Corona patient experiences such agonizing symptoms.”

Conclusion: We found the above post wrong after checking the facts. Claims made through viral videos on social media are false. This video does not depict a coronavirus-infected policeman in Bhagalpur Central Jail in Bihar, but in fact is a video of a mock drill.
