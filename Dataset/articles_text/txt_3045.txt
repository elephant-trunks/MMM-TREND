We first broke the video into few keyframes and started searching through the reverse image tool on Google. Here, we found the full video of the viral clip on YouTube, which was uploaded on December 4, 2021.

As per the video description, this video is of 22-year-old martyred jawan Lokesh Kumawat, who was a resident of Mawta village, Kalukheda police station, in Madhya Pradesh.

A similar video — uploaded in October 2021 — was also found, claiming that it was the funeral of martyr Harish Parmar from Gujarat’s Kheda district.

Hence, it is clear that an old video is being shared with misleading claims.
