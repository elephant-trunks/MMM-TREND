Days before the United States Presidential election, scheduled on November 3, an image showing a huge crowd has gone viral on social media, claiming that it is a Donald Trump rally in Florida.

Several Facebook users have shared the picture with the caption, “Trump rally in Florida”. Some have also used an image of a tweet purportedly made by Trump showing the viral image.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the picture to be false. The image is from the 2018 Street Parade music festival in Switzerland.

The archived versions of the posts can be seen here, here, here and here.

The viral picture

Using reverse image search, we found the viral picture in the 2018 photo gallery section in the website of Switzerland’s street parade festival.

This can be also confirmed by comparing the viral image with the original one.

The Street Parade music fest is held every year in Zurich. The annual event was cancelled this year due to the pandemic.

We found that the viral post surfaced after Trump held a huge rally at Ocala International Airport in Florida on October 16.

On October 17, Trump tweeted “GIANT RED WAVE COMING!” But in the post, he did not use a picture.

The same viral image was earlier used to make a misleading claim that it was a massive protest against restrictions over coronavirus in Berlin. It was debunked by fact-checkers.

Hence, it is confirmed that a two-year-old image from the Switzerland street parade music festival has been passed off as Trump’s rally in Florida.
