The image of the Hindi newspaper clipping posted by Facebook users has the blaring headline, “Approval for increase in MP allowance”. The report says that the Union Cabinet has approved increase in various allowances of MPs. Netizens have reacted strongly on this Facebook post, believing that the government has indeed increased MP allowances.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the newspaper clipping is from 2018 when the Union cabinet had approved 55 per cent increase in monthly allowances for MPs. There has been no further increase in MP allowances recently. Rather, MP allowances and salaries were reduced last year due to the pandemic.

No increase in MP allowance

With the help of keyword search, we found that the image of the newspaper clipping went viral in 2018 when many users posted it on social media. Several news reports from February 2018 had confirmed that the Centre did increase MP allowances after approval from the Union cabinet. According to these reports, the monthly allowances of Members of Parliament (MPs) were set to increase by Rs 40,000 per month, with the Union cabinet approving up to 55 per cent hike.

But no recent media report states that the central government has decided to increase MP allowances further.

Rather, we found that last year, MPs faced salary cuts and reduction in allowances due to the pandemic. On April 7, 2020, “The Economic Times” said MPs will have to forfeit Rs 27,000 every month from their constituency and office allowances. This was apart from the 30 per cent cut in monthly salaries.

Hence, it can be confirmed that the viral image is of an old newspaper clip and there has been no recent increase in monthly allowances for MPs.
