BOOM spoke to Shrut Kirti Somavanshi in September 2020, who is an IPS officer from the Madhya Pradesh Cadre. He rubbished the narrative associated with the viral image and said us that the three of them are neither siblings nor are they related to each other. BOOM ran a reverse image search and found the image was posted on Instagram on August 22, 2020, by Pooja Vashistah, then an IPS probationer of the Haryana cadre. Shrut Kirti Somavanshi and Tushar Gupta were tagged on the image. Tushar Gupta an IPS 2018 batch, from the Punjab cadre, further told us at that time, "the photograph was clicked in an IPS mess after a training session." Gupta also posted the same image on his Instagram profile. BOOM debunked the image first in September, 2020 when it went viral with the same false claims.
