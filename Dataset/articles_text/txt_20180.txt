The Supreme Court on July 1 strongly condemned the suspended BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma and said that she should apologize to the entire country. The judges who were included in the bench were Justice Surya Kant and Justice JB Pardiwala.

After this comment, people on social media started claiming judge JB Pardiwala was congress MLA between 1989-90.

A user on Facebook writes, “Nupar apologizes to the country by coming on TV” – Supreme Court.”

“Nupur Sharma responsible for Kanhaiyalal’s murder” – Supreme Court Judge J.B Pardiwala (Congress MLA 1989-90) Understand something?” (Translates Hindi)

Another user shared a picture stating the same claim.

Fact Check:

To investigate on this claim DFRAC checked the profile of Justice JB Pardiwala that is available on the website of the Supreme Court. It is told here, that he was born in the year 1965 in Mumbai. His father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all were lawyers. It is also written here that JB Pardiwala’s father Burjor Kawasji Pardiwala had been the Speaker of the Seventh Gujarat Legislative Assembly.

Gujrat Vidhan Sabha website shows Burjor Kawasji Pardiwala was the speaker from January 1, 1990 to March 16, 1990.

In the website of the Election Commission, the information of Burjor Kawasji Pardiwala winning the 1985 Gujarat Assembly Elections as a Congress Party candidate is provided.

It is clear from our investigation that Justice JB Pardiwala being a Congress MLA in the past is completely fake.
