A digitally altered picture of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra wearing a crucifix is doing rounds on social media platforms with claims that she sported it when in Kerala. The morphed photo is being shared with another image where Vadra can be seen wearing a rudraksh. Both the pictures are viral with claims that Vadra wore the crucifix when in Kerala to appeal to the Christian community of the state.
