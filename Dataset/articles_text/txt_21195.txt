Russia launched a broad attack on Ukraine from multiple directions early Thursday, February 24, bombarding cities, towns, and villages, and advancing toward the capital, Kyiv. Amid the escalating conflict, a video showing a group of people running down an escalator in panic has gone viral.

Several social media users shared this video with the claim, “This isn't people fleeing from Afghanistan or Syria. This stampede is to duck under a bunker to survive a possible missile or nuclear attack by Russia on Ukraine.”

AFWA PROBE

Upon reverse-searching keyframes of the viral clip, we found the same video on the YouTube channel of CNBC News. It was shared by the channel in October 2018.

The caption on this video said, “Escalator accident in Rome subway station injures soccer fans”. The same video was also found on the YouTube channel of Global News on the same day with the same caption.

Taking a cue from this, we conducted a keyword search to find out the details of the incident.

We found a report published by The Independent. It stated that on October 23, 2018, 20 football fans, including a few Russians, got injured after an escalator at a metro station in Rome malfunctioned and sped up.

The football fans were heading to a Champions League match between Roma and CSKA Moscow. The Independent also published the viral video in the report.

Therefore, we can conclude that the claim along with this video is misleading. This video has no connection with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. It was shot in October 2018 when an escalator carrying football fans at a metro station in Rome malfunctioned.
