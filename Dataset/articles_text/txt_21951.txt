French President Emmanuel Macron has been an outspoken critic of Islamic fundamentalism since the beheading of a teacher in Paris. Countries such as Pakistan and Turkey, in turn, have criticised Macron for his remarks. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan even accused the French President of encouraging "Islamophobia". And now, news reports say France has come down hard on Pakistani citizens, cancelling tourist visas and forcibly deporting over a hundred in response to the comments.

Many media reports say French authorities cancelled visas of 183 Pakistani citizens and deported 118 from the country. Those deported include the sister of a former ISI chief, the reports say.

All these media reports have used a tweet posted by the username "Consulate General Of Pakistan France", with the handle "@PakConsulateFr". The tweet says, "183 visitor visa provided to our citizens has been found to be rejected by french authorities following the criticism by PM Imran khan. 118 citizen with proper documents were deported forcefully. We're currently in touch with french authority to give our citizens temporary stay."

The same Twitter handle also claimed that France has deported former ISI chief Lt Gen Shuja Pasha's sister.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that "@PakConsulateFr" is an imposter account of the Pakistani embassy in France. The original Twitter handle is "@PakinFrance".

The archived versions of the posts can be seen here, here, here and here. AajTak did the same mistake but later corrected it.

The imposter account

The Pakistani embassy in France tweeted a screenshot of the imposter account and said it has only one Twitter handle, i.e. "PakinFrance", and anything else claiming to represent the embassy is fake.

The Embassy of Pakistan in Paris, France has only one Twitter account @PakInFrance. Any other account claiming to represent the Embassy anywhere in France is fake & misleading & may be reported to @Twitter.@FakeNews_Buster @ForeignOfficePk @MoIB_Official pic.twitter.com/35y7NhXBkh — Embassy of Pakistan, Paris, France (@PakinFrance) November 1, 2020

Pakistani media outlets have also reported about the imposter account tweeting misleading information.

With the help of "TweetBeaver", we found "@PakConsulateFr" was created only in April this year. With 446 followers, hardly any of them verified, this account has posted only 27 tweets so far. It does not have any link with Pakistani embassy website.

On the other hand, the original Twitter handle of the Pakistani embassy in France has 4,702 followers, including several verified handles. This nine-year-old account has posted over 20,000 tweets till now.

Therefore, it can be concluded that reports of France rejecting visas and deporting Pakistanis following Imran Khan's comments on Macron is misleading. However, a European Member of Parliament from France recently called Pakistan "the leaders of fake passports and fake documents".
