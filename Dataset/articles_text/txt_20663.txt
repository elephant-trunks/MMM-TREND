Fact Check:

On looking at the breaking plate, it appears that it is fake, as its words have not been properly aligned, which is usually done in fake breaking plates. Still, we searched on Google to check the veracity of this news. We could not find any news or link regarding this post.

After this, we looked on this braking plate and found that the logo of “K News” was on its corner. The news was allegedly claimed to be broadcast by “K News”. After which we searched on the Twitter and YouTube channel of “K News”. But we did not get any such news. After this, our team contacted the officials of “K News”. He told that no such news has been run by our channel. This is completely fake.

Let us tell you that such rumors have been raised about Dimple Yadav in the past that she is a relative of Yogi Adityanath or that Dimple Yadav seems to be Yogi Adityanath’s sister from a distant relation. Fact check of this rumour has already been done by Jansatta.
