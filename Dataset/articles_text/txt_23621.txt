On November 16, 2017, chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath claimed that the law and order situation had improved in the state, and not a single riot had taken place during the eight months of his government.

"When we came to power, hooliganism was at its peak and there was not a day when riots did not take place," Adityanath said. "The governments at the helm used to call over rioters and honour them but in these eight months not a single riot has taken place".

We fact-checked his claim and found it to be false.

As many as 60 incidents of communal riots were reported in Uttar Pradesh till May 2017, which killed 16 people and injured 151, according to data presented by the ministry of home affairs in the Parliament on August 8, 2017. (IndiaSpend had reported this on August 12, 2017).
