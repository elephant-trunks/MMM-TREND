Actor and Bigg Boss 13 winner Sidharth Shukla died of heart attack today in Mumbai’s Cooper Hospital, shocking the film fraternity. Soon after, a CCTV footage of a man collapsing on a staircase started circulating on social media with the claim that it shows the last moments of the ‘Balika Vadhu’ actor.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading. This video is at least a week old and shows a man collapsing at a gym in Bengaluru.

The same video is also circulating with the claim that the man collapsed in a Mumbai gym due to cardiac arrest since he was working out after taking a Covid-19 vaccine.

AFWA probe

On the first frame of the CCTV footage in question, we could see the date stamp as “25/08/2021”. This confirms that the video is at least a week old.

With the help of InVID tool and keyword search, we found the same video and screenshots from it shared by news websites from Karnataka.

According to these reports, the video is from Gold’s Gym at Banashankari, Bengaluru.

When AFWA reached out to the gym, a representative confirmed to us that the video is indeed from the gym and the incident took place in August. The representative also said that the man collapsed due to cardiac arrest.

An inspector from Banashankari police station also confirmed to us that the video is from Bengaluru. Police said he was declared brought dead to the hospital by doctors.

Meanwhile, 40-year-old Sidharth Shukla breathed his last in Mumbai on September 2. According to reports, he was brought dead to Cooper Hospital on Thursday morning. Primary reports say the actor suffered a heart attack.

Hence, it is clear that the video in question is old and from Bengaluru. It is neither from Mumbai nor related to Sidharth Shukla.
