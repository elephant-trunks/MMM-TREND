Amid the call for a boycott of Qatar Airways, the screenshot of a tweet, purportedly from the official Twitter handle of Qatar Airways, has surfaced on the Internet which reads ‘First learn how to spell boycott’.

The post can be seen here.

After as many as 15 Islamic nations, including Qatar, condemned the remarks by former BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma against the Prophet, many special media users called for a boycott of Qatar Airways.

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above tweet and found it to be FAKE.

On scanning through the official Twitter handle of Qatar Airways (@qatarairways), we did not find any such tweet.

Moreover, on closely observing the screenshot in question, we noticed that the font of the text is different from the actual tweet.

So, it is clear that the tweet in the screenshot is digitally manipulated and Qatar Airways did not make such a comment.
