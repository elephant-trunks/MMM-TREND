A video of Shashi Tharoor went viral on social media recently with questionable claims. The Congress leader was seen clapping and dancing to a Bollywood song. Many claimed this was from the three-day Congress Chintan Shivir in Udaipur, Rajasthan, earlier this month.

Archived versions of these posts can be seen here and here.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the video was not from Rajasthan but from Kerala. The Bollywood song was later digitally added to the video.

AFWA Probe

At the four-second mark of the viral video, we noticed the name of Uma Thomas, written in Malayalam on the back of the wall with "UDF" in English. The UDF or the United Democratic Front is an alliance of centre and centre-left political parties in Kerala.

Using this clue, subsequent searches led us to a Jansatta news report from May 19 that said Tharoor was seen and filmed dancing in Kerala during a Mahila Congress event.

Asianet News also reported on May 19 that Tharoor took part in the Thrikkakara bye-election campaign for Congress candidate Uma Thomas where he danced with women party workers during the release of an election song composed by the Mahila Congress.

Tharoor himself tweeted this video on May 18, writing "My 'Chambikko' moment today (for translation, ask a Malayali!)." The song playing in the background was not the Bollywood number heard in the viral video, proving that it was digitally added later.

Thus, we concluded that the video was not from Udaipur's Congress Chintan Shivir and that the Bollywood song in the video was added later.
