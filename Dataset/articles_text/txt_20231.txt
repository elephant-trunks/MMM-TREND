A video is getting viral on the internet with the claim that the Gulf countries are sending back Indians who have migrated there for work. Further, sharing the video a user named Lallulal Yadav wrote the caption, “कुवैत से घर वापसी(gharwapsi in Kuwait).”

Similarly, another user Surendra Sharma shared the video with caption, “Arab Qatar was the first which fired people from Kuwait, ready to come to India, there is no livelihood here, not even foreigners have eaten

* Some 60,000 people are being returned to India from Arab countries. Action has started in Qatar Kuwait Arab countries. If Modi is there, its possible.”

(“अरब कतर कुवैत से पहला नौकरी से निकाल दिया गया लोग भारत आने के लिए तैयार यहां तो रोजी रोटी है नही विदेशो का भी खा गया *कोई लगभग 60,000 लोग अरब देश से भारत वापस किये जा रहे हैं. कतर कुवैत अरब देशों में कार्रवाई चालू हो गई है. मोदी है तो मुमकिन है”)
