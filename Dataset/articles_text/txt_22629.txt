Opposition MPs are protesting in Parliament over the passage of the new V.B.G. Ramji Bill, which replaces the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). The bill was passed via a voice vote on the last day of the winter session. Protesting MPs claim the name change is a 'sheer disrespect' to Mahatma Gandhi. While Congress members held a silent protest with portraits of the Mahatma, Trinamool Congress MPs raised slogans at the Makar Dwar. The opposition argues the new bill weakens the rights-based guarantee and transforms it into a ration scheme controlled from Delhi.
