Russia’s ‘military operation’ in Ukraine, which entered its second day on Friday, has kept the people across the world glued to news and social media to get all the latest updates related to Russian invasion. Social media platforms, acting as a medium of information dissemination, are swamped with visuals depicting the ‘current situation’ in Ukraine. One such video, showing a fighter plane, is being widely shared on social media claims to show the recent attacks on Ukraine. However, Newschecker has found out that the viral footage is a video game clip shared out of context.

The video is doing the rounds on Twitter with the claim to show Russian attack on Ukraine.

The video is going viral on Facebook also with the caption, “This is how it looks in Russia in full power with Ukraine right now.”

Russia’s military action in Ukraine entered the second day on Friday. Several world leaders including Joe Biden, Boris Johnson condemned Russia’s move. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video statement, “I have asked 27 European leaders whether Ukraine will be in NATO …. Everyone is afraid, no one answers.” At least 137 Ukrainians lost their lives in Russian attacks.

Fact Check/Verification

To verify the authenticity of the video, Newschecker skimmed through the comments associated with the viral clip and found that multiple users had pointed out that it was footage from the Arma 3 video game. Others commented that it was available on YouTube.

Taking a clue, we conducted several keywords searches for ‘Arma 3,’ ‘Arma 3 Video Game,’ ‘Arma 3 fighter plane’ on YouTube and found a 0:43 seconds video uploaded on a YouTube channel called ‘Compared Comparison’ on January 6, 2022, with the title ‘A-10 Warthog Missile Gun Run – C-RAM – Military Simulation – ArmA 3 #Shorts’

At 10 seconds, we spotted the clip of a fighter plane going viral with the claim to show Russia’s attack on Ukraine.

We also came across a tweet by user @SoloNoah_ who also shared the link of the YouTube video.
