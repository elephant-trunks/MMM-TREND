Senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader and former Governor of Meghalaya and Tripura Tathagata Roy recently blamed the Mamata Banerjee-led government in West Bengal for the rising petrol prices. He claimed that the state tax was higher than the Centre's.



"This rate chart should be hanged in every petrol pump. Basic rate - Rs 30.50, Central Govt tax - Rs 16.50, West Bengal Govt's tax - Rs 38.50 and Distributor's charge - Rs 06.50. Total price of petrol - Rs 92.05. Now public must understand for price hike who is responsible and how much responsible?" he tweeted in Bengali. pic.twitter.com/gw8wEXqM6G — Tathagata Roy (@tathagata2) July 11, 2021 But this claim is false. According to the data released by the Petroleum and Planning Analysis Cell, a body under the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, the Rs 32.90 levied as central excise is higher than the total tax and cess imposed by the West Bengal government.

Fact-check: Petrol price breakup In 2010, the prices of petrol were determined by the government and were revised every fortnight. In 2014 the price of diesel was also deregulated and since 2017 prices are being revised on a daily basis. Since then, the public sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) make decisions on pricing of petrol and diesel based on international product prices, exchange rate, tax structure, inland freight and other cost elements, according to a March 8, 2021 Lok Sabha response. These OMCs are Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL). According to the PPAC, in West Bengal, the end consumer pays a total of:

Price to dealer

Central excise (A Union government levy)

Value added/Sales tax (A state government levy): 25%

Additional tax on VAT as irrecoverable tax: 20%

Re 1/litre cess (Minus Re 0.017 exemption)

Dealer commission
