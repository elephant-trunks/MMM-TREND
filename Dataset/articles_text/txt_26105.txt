Former Pakistan ambassador Abdul Basit has claimed that BJP leader Naveen Kumar Jindal is the brother of famous industrialist Sajjan Jindal.

YouTube channel Kaleidoscope captiond , “Imran Khan Deserves Credit and Uploaded 7.14 min video with “Moditva” Draws Flak From Muslim World.In the intro of the video, Abdul Basit claimed, “Everybody knows Naveen Jindal, who is very famous in our Pakistan, younger brother of (industrialist) Sajjan Jindal.” Next he talks about the reaction of the Muslim world. As evident from the caption, he credits all this to the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan.

Fact Check:

We searched on the internet about BJP leader Naveen Kumar Jindal and found that BJP leader Naveen Jindal has nothing to do with industrialist Sajjan Jindal.

Industrialist Jindal does not have Kumar in his name, while the BJP leader has “Kumar” in his name.

Sajjan Jindal’s brother, “Naveen Jindal“, mentioned by former Pakistani Ambassador Abdul Basit, is a billionaire industrialist from India. He defeated his nearest rival Abhay Singh Chautala from Kurukshetra, Haryana by a margin of 130,000 votes in 2004 on a Congress party ticket. In 2009, he was re-elected to the Lok Sabha.

Conclusion:

It is clear from this fact check of DFRAC that the claim made by former Pakistani Ambassador Abdul Basit is misleading.
