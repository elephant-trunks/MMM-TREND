The United States left behind billions of dollars' worth sophisticated weaponry, including attack helicopters and armoured vehicles, as they pulled out of Afghanistan. Visuals of Taliban taking over Kabul airport and posing with US choppers have been circulating on social media.

Amid this, a video of a helicopter going zigzag on a road is being shared with the claim that Taliban is learning to fly American choppers. “Special Black Hawk Taxi Service, #Afghanistan Taxi Operator — #Taliban,” says one such caption.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading. The video is linked to the Libyan conflict and was taken last year.

A reverse search of keyframes of the video led us to a Vietnamese news website which had used a still from the viral clipping in a report on the Libyan conflict.

The Libyan conflict is primarily between the Government of National Accord (GNA) and Libyan National Army (LNA). According to the news report, in June last year, GNA forces cleared Tripoli International Airport of LNA fighters and captured a large cache of heavy weaponry, including helicopters.

Russian media “Piter.TV” also gave out similar information. A Twitter user had even shared the same video on June 5, 2020.

Therefore, it is clear that even though there are fears of American weapons falling into Taliban hands, the viral video is not related to the crisis in Afghanistan, but the conflict in Libya.
