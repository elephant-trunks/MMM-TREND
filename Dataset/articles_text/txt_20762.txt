A video is being shared online showing a woman getting abducted on the street by a man. The video seems like it a CCTV footage and being shared online with a claim that women of India must be protected at all cost.

Fact-Check:

However, after reverse searching the claim, we found that the video was posted by Sajjanna Galrani, a verified account on Facebook who regularly posts dramatized videos to create awareness.

Since the video is dramatized and not a real incident, this claim is false.
