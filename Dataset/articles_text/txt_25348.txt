Strangely the same video was viral in February 2018 but that time it was just the opposite. BJP supporters claimed this to be Gujarat and this vandalism organized by ANti Modi / Jignesh Shah, Hardik Patel etc.

Truth

First of all, there is no Ashok Saxena to be found as BJP MP, so quote can’t be affiliated to him.

Secondly this vandalism took place in February 2018 reported to be in Chalisgaon, Maharastra. The reason for this was the Daily wage workers were not paid their wages.

A Indian Portal dedicated to Nature and energy reported

“Watch: #SolarPanels at 100 Mw solar plant in #Maharashtra#vandalized due to non payment of wages- for more information visit – http://www.climatesamurai.com/

The same was tweeted by NDTV News Anchor Gargi Rawat

This really hurts😕 Wish this had been handled better by authorities, optics so bad-

It was also reported by Go News 24X7 whose director is one of the most popular senior journalist Pankaj Pauchari

“Employees of a solar plant in Maharashtra’s Chalisgaon, vandalise the solar panels as a protest against non payment of their wages. “
