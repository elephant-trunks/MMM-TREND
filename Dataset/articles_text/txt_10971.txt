Yandex reverse image search on keyframes led us to a YouTube Channel where the same video was uploaded two years ago.

It is mentioned in the caption that this is a visual of Ariel Parade Rehearsal on 4 May 2020 in which flights are flying over Tushino city of Russia.

The Moscow Times had also uploaded it on their YouTube channel.

The caption with the video says, “Seventy-four Russian military airplanes and helicopters flew over Moscow today to rehearse for Russia’s Victory Day celebration. The main event on May 9 will mark 75 years since the Soviet victory over Nazi forces in World War II.”
