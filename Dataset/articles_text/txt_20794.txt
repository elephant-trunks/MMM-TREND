The reality behind this picture:

On performing simple image search, we found an article of a website called ‘Theartsdesk.com’ which had the same photograph and had mentioned that it was a part of the aforementioned play which was shown at London’s Hampstead Theatre.

Hence, the viral image is from a play titled ‘Drawing the Line’ by Howard Brenton which revolves around Cyril Radcliffe and the part that he played in India’s partition in 1947. According to the theatre’s official website, actors Silsa Carson and Lucy Black played the roles of Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten respectively.
