Elections are coming so is the tactics of elections. On 22nd January a video got viral which was posted by a user named Kamlesh Jain Jain on Facebook. He captioned the video claiming that Government in UP has started bribing people for votes. Distribution of money has begun in UP for casting votes. In the video, a man is holding an envelope embedded by BJP’s party sign.

In simpler words- People are claiming that BJP is distributing money in UP for casting votes.

Fact check:

The video which is getting viral is not of this election. BJP has distributed money but in the previous election. The case of bribery is of Huzurabad Bypoll where TRS and BJP gave cash during election campaigns for casting votes. According to the report of India Today, per person, 5000rs were given to cast a vote in the family. On 28 October, 2021.

Few videos got viral during the time of the Huzurabad Assembly Election in Telangana.We got another video of the same day, 28th October 2021 in which the same red-Sandow guy is distributing money.

Conclusion: The claim in the video is misleading as bribery for votes were done in Huzurabad Bypoll elections and not in UP elections
