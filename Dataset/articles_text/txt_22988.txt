India Today Fact Check found that Sibal was not slapped by anyone, but was mistakenly hit by a microphone of a Surya Samachar media person.

The video has already been shared more than 3,000 times from different Facebook pages and accounts.

When we searched this video on the internet, we found a full version of it on a YouTube channel, SPN9NEWS .

The video is from Jharkhand High Court premises, Ranchi, where on Friday, Sibal was briefing the media about the hearing of Lalu Prasad Yadav's fodder scam case.

Many prominent media houses have also covered the court hearing.

A close look of the video shows that Sibal was hit by a Surya Samachar microphone after which Sibal can be seen wincing in pain.

To confirm the incident, we also reached out to the Ranchi correspondent of Surya Samachar, Brajesh Roy. He confirmed that due to a push from behind, he lost his balance and the microphone accidently hit Sibal's face.

We also tried to contact Kapil Sibal to know his reaction on the incident but he didn't any response from him at the time of writing of this story.
