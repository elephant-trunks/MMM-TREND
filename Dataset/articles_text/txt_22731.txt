From the golden paddy fields of Assam to winning gold on international tracks, Hima Das has made Indians realise their dream. With five gold medals in less than three weeks on European circuits, the Dhing Express has left the Tricolour fluttering high, proving that she is the best among the best.

With Das becoming a household name amid celebrations in every nook and corner of India, a video has surfaced on social media apparently showing members of Das’s family reacting after she won a gold medal.

Among others, Facebook page Chetna Manch Dhaka’ posted a video last week that shows a few men, women and children sitting in a room watching TV. A few moments later, a woman breaks down and rushes out of the room.

The viral post claims that this is the reaction of Das’s family members after she won a gold medal. The archived version of the post can be seen here.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be untrue.

Using keywords, we started searching for the video on Google and YouTube and found that the same video was uploaded on YouTube by one Saidur Rehman on September 3, 2018, with the caption Hima Das family’.

This proves that the video is old and not after she won the gold medals last month. But then, a post in the comment section caught our eye. The post said, This is not the family of Hima Das but heptathlete Swapna Barman.

We then searched Google with the keyword Swapna Barman family’ and came across this video. The video was uploaded by Hindustan Times on August 30, 2018, when Barman became the first Indian heptathlete to win a gold medal in the Asian Games. We also came across quite a few media reports regarding this.

The same video was uploaded on the India Today website as well which can be seen here.

Thus, it can be concluded that the people seen in the viral video are not family members of sprinter Hima Das but heptathlete Swapna Barman.
