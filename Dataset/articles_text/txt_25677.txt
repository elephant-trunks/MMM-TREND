FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the post, and found it to be edited.

We ran a keyword search and traced a report by News 18 from 2022, in which the screengrab of the same video was featured. According to the article, the video shows Meryl Davis and Charlie White performing at the Winter Olympics 2010 in Vancouver.

The article says: ‘Meryl Davis and Charlie White partnered up way back in 1997, and since then have won various titles and held the position of world champions for five consecutive years’.

We also found the full video of performance on the official YouTube channel of Olympics. The video was uploaded on the channel on July 15, 2019, with a caption: “Meryl Davis & Charlie White honour Bollywood music and dance! | Music Monday”

The video description reads: “Team USA’s Meryl Davis & Charlie White paid homage to the rich tradition of #Bollywood music and dance with this sensational performance from Vancouver 2010!”

The duo originally performed on the Bollywood songs ‘Kajra Re’, ‘Silsila Ye Chahat Ka’, and ‘Dola Re Dola’.

Hence, it is clear that the video was edited and the original song was replaced by some other Radhe Krishna songs.
