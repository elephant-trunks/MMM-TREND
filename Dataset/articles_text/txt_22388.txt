Social media is full of home remedies and food habits to be followed, more often than not unverified, to beat the deadly Covid-19 pandemic. The latest 'advisory' doing the rounds on Internet has a logo of World Health Organization (WHO) and asking people not to eat bakery items as they are not washable and get infected from the coronavirus easily.

The message says, "Stop eating bakery items! It is strictly advised to not to eat bakery items as it is not washable and can get infected to the virus easily." The image gives the impression that the advisory has been issued by WHO amid the Covid-19 crisis. The archived version of the post can be seen here.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that WHO has not issued any such advisory related to bakery items during the ongoing pandemic. There is no evidence yet to suggest that bakery items get easily contaminated from coronavirus.

As of now, WHO and experts have issued some basic protective measures against the novel coronavirus which can be seen here.

As per the United States Food and Drug Administration, "currently there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with the transmission of COVID-19. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads."

Citing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), the report also says that "because of poor survivability of coronavirus on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures."

As of March 29 evening, coronavirus has claimed more than 32,000 lives globally and infected close to 7 lakh.
