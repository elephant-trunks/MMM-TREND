When our team investigated the AAP MLA’s claim. We found that during the routine checkup, the policeman had found an unlocked bike. Which the policeman was trying to take safely to the police station.

The UP Police also gave an explanation in this regard. And said that “the bike, which was keyed outside the bank, was being brought to the police station by the policeman from the point of view of security. The vehicle was not being stolen. This has also been denied by @hapurpolice in this regard. Please don’t spread rumors by posting misleading without verification.”

On the other hand, the news channel AajTak also issued a clarification regarding the story they had published earlier about the same matter. They stated “Confirming the case, the police later informed that hundreds of vehicles are parked together in this area. Due to which there is a possibility of jam situation and theft. Vehicles whose locks are found open by police personnel. They are brought to the post from a protective point of view and made to stand.”

Hence, the claim of AAP MLA is false and fake.
