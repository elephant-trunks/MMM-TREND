A video showing a couple being chased by the police personnel near a gushing waterfall is widely shared on social media, claiming that police is beating tourists in Anakkampoyil and Thusharagiri, Kerala.

The video is shared on Facebook with a caption in the Malayalam: “ഇനി കുളിക്കാൻ ആനക്കാംപൊയിൽ, തുഷാരഗിരി തുടങ്ങിയ ഭാഗങ്ങളിലേക്ക് പോയാലുള്ള അനുഭവം ഇതായിരിക്കും” (English translation: This will be the experience if you go to places like Anakkampoyil and Thusharagiri to bathe.)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim, and found it to be MISLEADING.

We did a keyword search but could not find any credible media report corroborating the viral claim. If such an incident had happened, the mainstream media would have covered it.

Using the InVid Tool, we extracted keyframes from the viral video and performed a Reverse Image Search. The search directed us to a news report, published by Lokmat on July 18, 2022, carrying screengrabs similar to the viral video. According to the article, “there was a police crackdown on the rowdy tourists who performed stunts on the edge of the Rautwadi waterfall. Preventive action was taken against seven people this time.” Rautwadi waterfall is situated in Maharashtra.

Searching further, we found the same video uploaded by News18 with the description: “Some overzealous tourists were trying to climb the dangerous cliff at Rautwadi waterfall in Radhanagari taluk. Therefore, the police have given a good crackdown on these overzealous tourists.”

Thus, it is confirmed that the video from Maharashtra is falsely shared as that from Kerala.
