A photograph of a man sleeping on a chair with his mouth wide open while a group of people clicking a picture with him have gone viral on social media. It is being claimed that the man suffered a heart attack and died at work. But, his co-workers clicked selfie thinking of him fallen asleep while working.

India Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the claim with the viral post is misleading. The man in the picture didn't suffer a heart attack and is very much alive. He just dozed off while working in the office.

Facebook page "Do NOT TRY This AT Home! Oh Man, we have to do this" shared the photograph with the text written on it: "Man suffers heart attack, dies at work, coworkers gather for group selfie thinking he'd fallen asleep."

To verify the claim with the viral photo, we ran a reverse search and found that the man in the picture didn't suffer a heart attack but fallen asleep while working. We found many media reports telling how this man dozed off in the office and how he's become an internet meme.

As per the media reports published back in 2016, Eduard Paraschivescu was an intern at a company called Gsoft. It was his second day in the office when he felt tired and fallen asleep. His co-workers then took a selfie with him which he posted on Reddit. Later, people humorously modified his photo and created memes out of it.

In an interview with Huffington Post, he told: "One of the associates noticed me sleeping and it just went downhill from there".

Hence, it is clear that the man in the viral photo is not dead but alive and doing well. He just dozed off while working in the office.
