FACT CHECK:

We began our search by searching on google by using the key words ‘Pratapgarh, Maharshtra’. Upon this search, we came to know that Pratapgarh fort is in Satara District, Maharashtra.

Then we visited the Satara District Collector’s website to find out about Pratapgarh, where the photographs and details of Pratapgarh Fort were different than that in the one shown in the post. This cleared our doubt that the above post photograph is not of Pratapgarh.

Then we used ‘Google Reverse Image Search’ to search the existence of the image and we found out that this image is of a Fort in Warangal in Telengana.

A post by ‘Flickr.com’ mentioned that this image is of a gateway to Warangal Fort.

Based on the evidences we can confirm that the photograph in the post is not of Pratapgarh in Maharashtra. This photograph is of the gateway at Warangal Fort.
