Amid the ongoing farmers’ agitation, a short clip of Nihang Sikhs marching on the road has gone viral with the claim that 20,000 Nihang Sikhs on 2,000 horses are on their way to Delhi from Punjab to join the farmers. Nihangs are an order of traditional Sikh warriors.

The one-minute video shows men in blue turbans and robes on horseback and vehicles marching on the road carrying swords and other weapons. The video is viral on Facebook and Twitter.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. Although there are reports of a group of Nihangs joining the farmers’ protest, this particular video is two years old and has no link to the ongoing agitation.

Truth behind the video

With the help of InVID and reverse image search, we found that the video was posted by a YouTube user on November 16, 2018, with the title “Khalsa ki shaan”. The same video was also posted by a Facebook user on September 30, 2018, with the hashtag #DelhiFatehDivas2018.

The same video was again posted by another YouTuber in July this year with the caption, “Delhi Fateh Divas 2018 Budha Dal Nihang Singh”.

Sikhs celebrate Fateh Divas to mark the anniversary of a historic 18th-century event when the ‘Nishan Sahib’, the holy symbol of Khalsa Panth, was unfurled at Red Fort. News reports on this event can be read here.

Budha Dal, the head section of Nihang Sikhs that organises this event every year, confirmed to fact-check website "Boom Live" that the viral video is from 2018 during the Fateh Divas procession in Delhi.

As per news reports, a group of Nihangs did join the ongoing farmers’ protest near Delhi. But this particular video is from 2018 and has got nothing to do with the agitation.
