A photo purporting to show Prime Minister Narendra Modi bowing down to Saudi Arabia's king Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, is morphed and fake.



BOOM found that the original image shows Modi, then prime ministerial candidate bowing down to veteran Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Lal Krishna Advani in 2013 at a rally in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh.

Indian's diplomatic ties with Arab countries turned acerbic after BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma made inflammatory remarks about Prophet Mohammad in a television debate. Indian envoys were summoned by the Islamic countries. It also led to the suspension of Sharma and another BJP spokesperson Naveen Jindal was expelled. The image has been shared backdrop of this row. The morphed photo has been shared with Tamil text.

The photo created a stir at that time as Advani did not acknowledge Modi's gesture but instead looked away.
