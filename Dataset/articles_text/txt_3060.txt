A video of a landslide is being circulated on social media, claiming that it shows a recent landslide at Anmod Ghat at the Karnataka-Goa border.

Two incidents of landslide occurred at Anmod Ghat on July 4, 2022, following incessant rain in the region, bringing traffic on the Goa-Karnataka national highway (NH-4A) to a grinding halt.

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the post, and found it to be misleading.

On putting the keyframes of the video through Reverse Image Search, we found the same video uploaded by Hindustan Times on YouTube on July 31, 2021, with a title: “Watch: Road collapses during dramatic landslide in Himachal Pradesh’s Sirmaur”.

The video description reads: “Landslide in Himachal Pradesh’s Sirmaur caught on camera on Friday (July 30, 2021). In dramatic visuals, a portion of road collapsed in the Sirmaur region. The road reportedly caved in after incessant rainfall. National Highway 707 was blocked following the landslide. Over 165 people have been stranded in Lahaul-Spiti region. As per reports, three trekkers have been missing. Rescue work is going on in the area.”

The same video was also published by The Quint in July 2021, with a title: “Watch | Terrifying visuals of road collapse after landslide in Himachal.”

The report mentioned that the incident took place near Nahan town in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh.

Hence, it is clear that it is an old video from Himachal and is NOT related to the recent landslide at Anmod Ghat at the Karnataka-Goa border.
