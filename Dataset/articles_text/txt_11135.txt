Fact Check-

We started our investigation by running a Google reverse image search on the same whose results led us to this image published by the verified Twitter handle of 1TVNewsAF on 10 August,2015. 1TVNewsAF is a news organisation in Afghanistan.

The IBTimes posted this image on 10 August, 2015 stating that the blast was reported at the entrance of the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul in 2015.

We also found that Reuters had reported this incident on 10 August 2015 mentioning that a car bomb exploded near the entrance to Kabul airport and casualties were feared. This incident took place days after series of suicide attacks in the Afghan capital killed dozens and wounded hundreds. We found several other images on Reuters website after the bombing. You see a comparison image showing the similarities between the viral image and the images posted by Reuters in 2015.

Conclusion- Fact Crescendo found that the claim made along with the above-mentioned image is Partly False. Even though there was a blast at the Kabul airport but the image does not show the recent blasts but it dates back to 2015 showing a car bombing incident.
