A video of a bus accident is going viral on the internet. Sharing the video users are claiming that this is the live scene of a bus accident in Kullu. Further, a social media user Imtiyaz Ahamad who claims himself a freelance journalist on his Twitter bio shared a video. Along with the video he wrote, “More than 20 dead Bus accident #Kullu just see the ground zero report #ACCIDENT“

Similarly, many other users have share this video with the same claim.

Fact Check

Applying reverse image search on different frames of the video, we got a video on YouTube channel named 007comfort. The video was uploaded on 31st December, 2011 with the title, “Bus Accident In Bolivia ( Bolivia’s death road swallows a bus).”

Further, many media houses have covered this news. The title of the report is, “Horror as bus plunges off ‘Road of Death’ in Bolivia killing driver.” The driver died in the accident.

Conclusion

Therefore, the claim that this bus accident happened in Kullu is wrong. The incident took place in Bolivia. Hence, the claim of self-proclaimed Journalist Imtiyaz Ahamad along with the video is misleading.
