The claim read: “To celebrate 51 years of @ALDI, we’re sending out a special Gift Bag to everyone who types “Done”.”

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim and found it to be false.

We started our investigation with a Google search with relevant keywords, but we did not find any credible information about such a scheme.

On scanning through Alid’s social media handles, there was no post announcing the giveaway.

NewsMobile reached out to Aldi Stores UK on Twitter (@AldiUK), who confirmed to us that the above claim is baseless and not true. “We can confirm that this is not a genuine post from Aldi. We would recommend not to share any personal information,” Aldi UK told NewsMobile.

Hence, it is clear that the viral post is fake.
