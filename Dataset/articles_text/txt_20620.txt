Every day in the race of UP Elections, one or the other image gets viral. This time a picture of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra , general Secretary of All Indian Congress Party (INC) wearing a sari and worshiping in the temple goes viral.

People all over the internet are mocking her to wear a sari when UP elections are just around the corner.

Various accounts on Twitter are mocking her under the caption “ UP el has have started and grandmother sari has also come out from the cupboard, but you will get what’s hanging ##आएंगे_तो_योगी_ही”
