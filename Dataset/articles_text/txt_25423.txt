Spread the truth:

Photoshopping a woman’s dress to defame her is not acceptable. This Moonmoon Sen’s photo is edited.

Photoshopping images is a daily stuff for many, few do it just for the heck of it, few do it for politics, few to incite riots and few like this to defame women.

If you have any idea about image editing, you can check the blurred hair and mix of skin color.

Same was debunked by me, being the first in country with Deepika Padukone’s dress which someone edited to show entire breasts, while the actual one covered.
