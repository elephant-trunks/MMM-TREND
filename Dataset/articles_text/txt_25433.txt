Spread the truth:

This Air-conditioned Bus Stop is an @DaikinIndia Initiative, not AAP government.

This photo is getting viral claiming to be an initiative by AAP Government, although not by any official AAP ID but by supporters till now.

This is a CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) work by Daikin Air-conditioning Company, which also adds up to their advertisement.

Confirmed with Daikin Officials, this has been installed for 15 Days running on generator. May extend further.



They tweeted it as Initiative.

Could also be a Advertising Concept too, as this site claims, not credible though.
