FactCheck.

On our fact check analysis our team found that the Indian Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Railway Protection Special Force (RPSF) posted no such vacancies. Moreover, the Indian Railways posted on its official Twitter account that, the Ministry of Railways had published no such advertisement/notice. So be alert and beware of these fake claims.

Hence, the news of Indian Railways recruitments posted by these websites is totally false. Internet is the source of all the piece of information we want to acquire. But, sadly nowadays it is becoming very hard to distinguish between the genuine and fake information. We many times come up with such news. DFRAC team request our readers to verify every piece of information on internet.
