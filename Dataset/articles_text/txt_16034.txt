After actress Sonali Bendre was diagnosed with cancer, several messages regarding cancer and how to avoid getting the disease, started circulating on WhatsApp. One such forward on breast cancer reads as below:

This message has been widely circualted on all the social platforms, however Tata memorial Hospital has clarified that

“Tata Memorial Hospital doesn’t circulate any health-related messages or advisories on social media.”

We reached out to Dr Ashutosh Tondare , DNB, MBBS Oncology Dept., at Healthy Breasts clinic, to fact-check the contents of this message. He says:

“None of these points have anything to do with breast cancer. They’re all myths.”

The colour of your bra, whether black or white, has nothing to do with breast cancer, Dr Tondare adds.

And when it comes to wearing a bra while sleeping, it is advised to go to sleep without one. But that, again, has no connection to breast cancer.
