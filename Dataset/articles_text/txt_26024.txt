A collage of two pictures is going viral on social media. In one of the images in the collage, former Congress national president Rahul Gandhi and Riyaz Attari, the killer of Taylor Kanhaiya Lal in Udaipur, can be seen with him. On the other hand, Riyaz Attari and Ghaus Mohammad are in the second picture. Riyaz and Gauss have been accused of brutally killing tailor Kanhaiya Lal.

Sharing this picture, Facebook user Lallu Lal Yadav wrote – ” The real thing is, had you understood something.”

At the same time, many other users on Twitter and Facebook have shared this picture with the same caption.

Fact Check:

To find out the reality of the viral picture, we did a reverse image search on Google. We found a report published on 13 May 2019 in the English newspaper ‘ The Times of India ‘ . This picture of Rahul Gandhi has been used in this report. It can be seen in this picture that it is not Riyaz Attari but Hardik Patel with Rahul Gandhi. The picture is of the time when Hardik Patel joined Congress in the presence of Rahul Gandhi.

Therefore, our fact check proves that the original picture has Hardik Patel with Rahul Gandhi. Riyaz Attari’s picture is photoshopped out of Hardik Patel’s picture. Hence, the claims of social media users is fake.
