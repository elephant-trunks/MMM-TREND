"text-align: justify;">In February 2015, the budget of the women and child welfare ministry was cut by about half, from Rs 17,949.85 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 10,286.73 crore for 2015-16.

Women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi sparked a controversy earlier this week after telling Reuters that her departments were struggling, her observations interpreted as criticism of her own government.

“We still have problems because our cut has still not been restored," she told Reuters. "Literally, it's a month-to-month suspense on whether we can meet wages."

Gandhi is right. Factchecker.in found that the budget for women and child development has been cut by 51%.

There has been a steep decline in funding for schemes run by the ministry like integrated child development scheme (ICDS) and Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Empowerment of Adolescent Girls (RGSEAG).
