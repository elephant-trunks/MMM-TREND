The BJP has named Jagannath Sarkar from Ranaghat constituency.

Facebook page 'I Am Congress' and 'Bts Shameer' has also posted these photos. The post went viral on Twitter and other social media platforms as well.

India Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral photo has been taken from the party's recent rally in Ranaghat.

The president of BJP, West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh had shared the images of this rally through his official Facebook account on April 22. He captioned the images in Bangla that roughly says, 'Roadshow with Jagannath Sarkar in the Ranaghat Lok Sabha constituency.'

Ghosh shared a set of 12 images from the rally including the viral photo. Dilip Ghosh is contesting from Medinipur constituency.

In one of the images shared by Ghosh, Jagannath Sarkar can be seen campaigning with him and he is not dressed in Hanuman's attire.

It is clear that the man dressed as Hanuman is not BJP candidate Jagannath Sarkar.
