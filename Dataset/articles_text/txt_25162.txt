Truth

The above claims are misleading. The video posted initially that stated the US FDA has approved the medicine was taken from a CNN news segment. The video can be found here. Screenshots of the same are as follows:

Clinical trials have found that the drug shortens the recovery period of COVID-19 patients which resulted in FDA opening up the option for broader number of patients.

There is no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved product available to treat COVID-19”. The entire press release can be viewed here and screenshots are as follows:

The FDA further confirmed that the drug is still an investigational one and is being only administered to certain emergency COVID-19 patients in a fact sheet that be viewed here. A screenshot is as follows:
