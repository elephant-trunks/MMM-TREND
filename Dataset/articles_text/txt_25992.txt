Economist Steve Hanke got trolled on the social media platforms for one of his tweet. He requoted a picture along with the caption, “Chaos reign in #SriLanka. In Sohrabh Goth, Hundreds of violently protested the recent murder of a boy in Hyderabad, even setting up a bus and two motorcycle on ablaze, take a look.”

Fact Check

The caption of the tweet is factually wrong as Sohrab Goth is not in Sri Lanka but in Pakistan. As, Sohrab Goth is a suburban area in the Malir district of Karachi, Pakistan, that previously was a part of Gadap Town until 2011.

Though, he deleted the post later many social media users have criticized Hanke for his tweet. Further, a Facebook user Chrishan R Jayakody takes dig on him and wrote which can be nearly transelated into English, “Our brothers wore hankies, didn’t they? It is from sources like this that he takes information to make his inflation index.Don’t be fooled.”

Similarly, another user Atiq Ur Rehram, “Ignorance has no bounds. A senior economist of Johns Hopkins University and Director of Troubled Currencies Project believes that Sohrab Goth is in Sri Lanka. This is how western development index builders and economists typically look at the developments taking place in any country and project situations. But I am sure Steve will correct his mistake. But many of our experts deliberately colorize every opinion and situation with their emotional attachment with their loved political parties and manipulate facts the way they like.”

Conclusion

Sohrab Goth is not in Sri Lanka. Therefore, the tweet of Steve Hanke was Wrong.
