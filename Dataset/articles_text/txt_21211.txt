As the hijab row in Karnataka continues, social media continues to witness misinformation related to the issue. In the many viral posts surrounding the matter, one is a video showing police officers beating a group of burqa-clad women.

The video has been widely shared with the claim that it shows Karnataka police hitting Muslim women who were protesting against the hijab ban in educational institutions. A burqa-clad woman could also be seen trying to stop a policeman from lathi-charging her.

One such post can be seen below.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the claim along with the video was misleading. While the women were indeed protesting against the hijab ban, this incident happened in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghaziabad, not Karnataka.

With the help of a keyword search, we found the same video shared by multiple media outlets on February 16, 2022.

According to these reports, the video was from a protest against Karnataka’s hijab ban held in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad.

According to an NDTV report, an FIR was filed by the police against the protesters over the incident.

As per the FIR, on February 13, police were informed that a group of Muslim women had gathered without taking permission in Ghaziabad's Sani Bazaar Road with anti-government posters. The FIR further said that women constables who asked the protestors to return home were heckled and the men who were with the protesting women hurled abuses at the constables.

However, when the video in question went viral on social media, and many criticised the police for using force on the women, the Ghaziabad police said they were investigating the video.

In the last few days, protests were held by Muslim organisations across the country condemning the Karnataka government for not allowing Muslim students to now wear hijab inside classrooms.

From the available information, it is clear that the video in question is from Uttar Pradesh, and not from Karnataka.
