Following the announcement of the ‘Agnipath’ scheme by the Centre on June 14, there have been massive protests in several states across the country.

Against this backdrop, a video in which a protester can be seen urging the government to roll back the scheme is being widely shared on social media.

The video is being shared on Facebook with a Hindi caption, “जब “अग्निपथ” पर चलने “अग्निवीरों” की बात आती है तो जेहन में सबसे पहले ऐसे “अग्निवीर” ही क्यों आ जाते हैं”

(English translation: When it comes to “firefighters” walking on “fire” Why do such “Agnivir” come first in Jehan)

Here’s the link to the above post.

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim and found it to be MISLEADING.

Upon carefully watching the video, we noticed the logo of ‘Principle of News’ in the top right corner. Taking a cue from this, we did a keyword search on YouTube and found the same video was uploaded on a channel named ‘Principle of News’ on January 28, 2022.

The video description reads, “I don’t know the meaning of RRB-NTPC but protest for the students doing it”. In this video, some journalists are seen questioning a person who describes himself as a supporter of Lalu Yadav and RJD.

Searching further, we found that in January 2022, there was a huge uproar in Patna with regards to the Railway-NTPC examination.

Though we could not ascertain the exact location and time of the viral video, it is evident from the above information that the video has been on the internet at least since January 2022 and is not related to the recent ‘Agnipath’ protests.
