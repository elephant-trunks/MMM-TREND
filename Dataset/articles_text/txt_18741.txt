A viral message claiming Bangalore police commissioner has warned people to be careful as incidents of thefts and kidnappings will be on the rise once the nationwide lockdown lifts, is fake. BOOM spoke to Bangalore police who confirmed that the message was fake and had not been issued by the department.

The message warns people to be careful about their belongings like mobile phones, jewellery and also asks children and elders to be extra careful. The message says people have to be careful as 'many did not have much earnings all these days so there might be a sudden spurt in incidents due to job loss and effect on business.'

The message is being shared on Facebook as: "Message from top cop of #Bangalore which every one should read, I feel. Caution. All of us whether in Cities or Towns, have to be aware of the situation. From May 3rd if the #lockdown is lifted partially fully, we cannot put much pressure on our #police department which had worked hard day in and day out all these days. The police force would be very tired and they also need to spend time with their families."
