Meanwhile, we get to see a video getting viral on social media, where a Muslim lady wearing a Hijab is seen beaten up by the police.

People all over the internet are sharing this video under #HijabRow, to tell the world about the atrocities faced by Muslims in India. The same video is shared by a Pakistani Youtube channel where they humiliated India on international grounds.

Fact Check:

To know the reality of this video we searched it and got to know that this video is of a woman who was wearing a Burqa and Hijab is basically a foreigner who allegedly stabbed a cab driver in gurugram, Haryana.

The cab driver was severely injured and admitted to the hospital for treatment. When police interrogated into the matter the women mishandled the policemen too as can be seen in the video by @live_Hindustan.

गुरुग्राम में बुर्का और हिजाब पहने हुई एक विदेशी महिला ने कथित तौर पर एक कैब ड्राइवर को चाकू मार दिया। घायल कैब ड्राइवर को इलाज के लिए अस्पताल में भर्ती कराया गया है। पुलिस आरोपी महिला को हिरासत में लेकर पूछताछ कर रही है। इस दौरान महिला ने पुलिसकर्मियों से भी हाथापाई की। pic.twitter.com/QYURAeY6iu — Hindustan (@Live_Hindustan) February 15, 2022
