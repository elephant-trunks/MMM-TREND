A series of images of a collapsed flyover is viral on social media with the claim that a metro line came crashing down in Mumbai. Some have shared the same pictures with the claim that it is from Ahmedabad.

The caption of one such Twitter post reads, "Metro Line Collapsed near Phoenix Mall Mumbai".

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claims to be misleading. The images are of a recent flyover collapse in Gurugram, and not from Mumbai or Ahmedabad.

The same pictures with the misleading claims were shared on Facebook, both in English and in regional languages. The archived versions of some of the posts can be seen here, here, here and here.

With the help of reverse image search, we found that the pictures are from Gurugram where a portion of an under-construction flyover collapsed on August 22.

Similar images were carried by multiple media houses which covered the incident. According to an August 23 report by "Hindustan Times", which carried one of the viral images, a section of a flyover being constructed on Gurugram's Sohna Road collapsed around 10 pm the night before, injuring two.

Similar images were also carried by "Live Mint" and "NDTV". We also found that one of the viral images was tweeted by Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala following the incident.

We could not find any recent reports of metro lines collapsing in either Mumbai or Ahmedabad. Hence, it can be said that the pictures of a flyover collapse doing the rounds on social media are from Gurugram and not from the two western metropolises.
