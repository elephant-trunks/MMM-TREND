A video, showing a burqa-clad man posing as a woman and kidnapping children, is widely shared on social media. The man can be seen chased by a car and is later caught. Sharing this video, users claim it to be a real incident.

The video is shared on Facebook with the caption: “बुर्के की आड़ में क्या-क्या गुल खिलाए जा रहे हैं कैसे-कैसे कामों को अंजाम दिया जाता है खुद ही देख लो आतंकवाद पर नकाब है बुर्खा आतंकवाद की गतिविधियों को छुपाता है बुर्खा क्राइम को बढ़ावा देता है बुर्खा बुर्के पर बैन लगना चाहिए भारत में”
