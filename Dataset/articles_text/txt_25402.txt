Truth

The photo was from a Chinese food festival “Diaoyutai Food Festival” held in April 2017 in Delhi attended by ministers from other parties as well.

We found this image easily by reverse searching on Google so how can these 2 big channels miss ?

Two possibilities

1. They can not not find a photo on Google – Not capable, not worth, so can they be believed ?

2. This was an intentional mistake. – you know it !
