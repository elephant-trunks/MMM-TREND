FACT-CHECK

Post investigations we found that the message in the viral image was not a genuine statement made by Donald Trump. We scrutinized all the tweets made by Trump; right from when he was infected to the time when he recovered. We did not find any message related to this topic in any of his tweet’s.

To begin with, we examined the viral message through a keyword search but we did not find any related news on the internet pertaining to the published message. Further, we scrutinized the twitter handle of President Donald Trump, and we found many videos and tweets where Trump has shared updates about coronavirus and the condition of his family and himself. In those tweets also, we did not find any such message or video which spoke about the subject of the viral message. On 2nd October, Donald Trump had tweeted that he had been infected with COVID-19.

Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2020

Thereafter, we carefully inspected all the videos and messages that he tweeted, but we did not find any tweet made by Donald Trump which would ascertain that the viral message was actually a statement made by him. In each of his tweets, he has thanked the doctors treating him, as well as health care workers and his well-wishers etc. He has also encouraged the people fighting Corona and mentioned about his and his family members’ health. You can see the same in the picture and tweet below.
