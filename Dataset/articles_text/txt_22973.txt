Amid the latest social media craze popularly called #10YearChallenge, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) launched its own challenge with hashtag #5YearChallenge on Twitter. Using this, the BJP is trying to showcase its achievements in five years with the help of photos of long-pending projects getting completed.

One of the tweets, shared by many official BJP Twitter handles, shows the work done in expressway construction. Juxtaposing two pictures, it is claimed that how a barren land turned into impressive Western Peripheral Expressway within five years of the NDA rule.

Here are some of the Twitter handles of the BJP which made this claim.

India Today Fact Check found that none of the images in the tweets are of Western Peripheral Expressway.

The first image is of the Lucknow-Agra Expressway which was inaugurated by Akhilesh Yadav in 2016. The second one is of Delhi-Meerut Expressway which is still under construction. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated its first phase in May 2018.

When we reverse-searched the first image, we found it on the website of American stock photography company Shutterstock.

The caption reads, "Lucknow; Uttar Pradesh; INDIA March 17, 2015, Aerial view of the under-construction new Agra-Lucknow Expressway, process with heavy equipment at the construction site."

It is interesting to note that the second image, which shows the road after completion, was earlier tweeted by Union minister Vijay Goel on May 26, 2018, as Delhi-Meerut Expressway.

Western Peripheral Expressway was inaugurated by PM Modi in November last year. It is also known as Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway.

According to Alt News the BJP official Twitter handle also shared this tweet but later deleted it.
