A claim against AAP (Aam Admi Party) is being circulated on social media sites. The viral news states that AAP in Punjab is deciding on cutting the pension plans of former MLA’s and ministers.

A Facebook user writes, “Punjab government took a big decision to stop pension of former MLAs and ministers those who used to ask, you will give 300 units of electricity-free, but from where will I get the money? Telling them that the pension of the former MLA and the minister has been stopped, 300 units of free electricity will be given to the public with the same money. When MPs, MLAs, ministers can get 4000 units of free electricity, why can’t the public get 300 units of free electricity? (Translates Hindi)

Fact Check:

When we searched the official twitter handle of Bhagwant Mann we found no such claim by him.

But, we do find a tweet that states, “Today, we have taken another big decision. The pension formula for Punjab’s MLAs will be changed. MLAs will now be eligible for only one pension. Thousands of crores of rupees that were being spent on MLA pensions will now be used to benefit the people of Punjab.”

Today, we have taken another big decision. The pension formula for Punjab's MLAs will be changed. MLAs will now be eligible for only one pension.
