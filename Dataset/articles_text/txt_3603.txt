🔥Hundreds of Muslims shouting to stop Poojas at Kali Matha Mandir in Kolkata, once poojas conducted by Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. They (so-called peace lovers) want to close the Mandir. What is this happening in our own country? Where are we? People of India to awake soon from their long sleep and observe what is happening around us. 🚩🙏
