Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Deb used a photo of the Bora Bora islands in an image wishing Goa on its Statehood Day. Deb tweeted a graphic featuring a picturesque image of the Bora Bora islands with seaside shacks with a mountain towering in the background, wishing the people of Goa saying, 'May the state prosper more'





Greetings to the beloved people of #Goa on their Statehood day.



May the State prosper more 🙏🏽@goacm @DrPramodPSawant pic.twitter.com/IJSqhCHsht — Biplab Kumar Deb (@BjpBiplab) May 30, 2020

In the tweet, Deb tagged the official Twitter account of the Goa chief minister's office and the personal account of Goa CM Pramod Sawant who also retweeted the tweet. An archive of the tweet can be found here.

Fact Check

BOOM found that the image is not of Goa but of the Bora Bora island in French Polynesia.

A reverse searched the image on Google showed the same image being used by various travel websites which described the image as being of the Bora Bora island.

BOOM found the original image on the free-to-use photo website Pixabay. The image was credited to photographer Julius Silver. The meta data revealed the image was shot in June 2011 and was uploaded on the site in December 2017.
