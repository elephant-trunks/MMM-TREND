Social media is awash with posts that paint the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as servile to the British Empire.

A black-and-white photo that has gone viral on Facebook purportedly shows a Sangh cadre giving a guard of honour to Queen Elizabeth II. "Rani Ko Salami Dete RSS... Angrezo Ke Ghulam," read its caption, denigrating the Sangh as a "slave" of the colonial rulers. "Desh Ki Azaadi Ke Pehle Ki Yeh Tasveer Gavahi De Rahi Hai. Jab Desh Ke Log Azadi Ke Liye Ladh Rahe The To Log Angrezo Ko 'Guard of Honour' De Rahe."

When India Today fact-checked the image, the results revealed the truth.

A historical fact: Elizabeth II is seen taking the guard of honour in the photo ascended to the throne on February 6, 1952, almost five years after India's independence. Her first visit to India as Queen came in 1961.

Now all that is sufficient to trash the claims that the image pre-dated independence.

We then undid the photoshopping skills of the Sangh's online opponents.

It was revealed that they had in fact superimposed pictures of RSS cadre on Nigerian troops during the Queen's arrival at the Kaduna airport back in 1956.

The original image showed the British monarch inspecting a guard of honour of the newly-renamed Queen's Own Nigeria Regiment, Royal West African Frontier Force. The superimposed pictures of Sangh cadre were found to be originally taken few years ago.

Fact-checking website SM Hoax Slayer and ABP News found the Sangh's "guard-of-honour" photo to be fake in 2016. Still, the image has gone viral yet again on social media.

Clearly, the photoshopping and its circulation on social platforms aimed at portraying the RSS as formerly a pro-British organisation.
