According to multiple news sources, PM Modi is all set to visit the newly renovated Kashi Vishwanath temple on December 13. The temple has been under renovation for a while and has gotten people excited about it as well.

Amidst this, a video of the temple’s new structure is being shared online by multiple users.

Fact-Check:

However, after reverse searching the image on google, we found that the video is actually of Somnath Temple in Gujarat and is being falsely shared online as the new temple building. We found multiple videos from different angles of the same building posted by the official account of Somnath Temple.

Since the video is not of Kashi Vishwanath Temple, this claim is misleading.
