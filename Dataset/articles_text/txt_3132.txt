Shiromani Akali Dal leader Simranjit Singh Mann won in the Sangrur Lok Sabha constituency by-poll. This seat was vacant as the sitting MP Bhagwant Mann resigned to become the Chief Minister of Punjab.

In the above context, a video showing people protesting against Bhagwant Mann during a press conference has gone viral on social media.

The post is shared with a caption: ” ਚੰਗੀ ਇੱਜਤ ਕਮਾ ਲਈ ਜਾਪਦੀ 3 ਮਹੀਨਿਆਂ ਚ ਨਗਦੋ ਨਗਦ ਬੇਇੱਜ਼ਤੀ.” (English translation: “Seems to have earned good respect in three months…cash insult.”)

FACT CHECK

When NewsMobile fact-checked the claim, it was found to be misleading.

On doing a Google Reverse Image Search with one of the screenshots, we found the same video uploaded by the Facebook page, United Congress, on January 24, 2022. The video was uploaded with a caption: “Journalists raised slogans and protested against Aam Aadmi Party during Bhagwant Mann’s press conference in Jalandhar. Journalists are opposing AAP all over Punjab.”

We also found the same video, tweeted by Punjab Congress on January 24, 2022, with a caption: “In Jalandhar, journalists raised slogans against Aam Aadmi Party at Bhagwant Mann’s press conference. Journalists are protesting against AAP all over Punjab.”

Bhagwant Mann took the oath as Chief Minister of Punjab on March 16, 2022. Hence, we can ascertain that the viral video is quite old and it is misleading.
