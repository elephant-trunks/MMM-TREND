Fact Check

We took a screenshot from the video and after reverse image search of that screenshot we found the same video on the official account of President Biden. The video was of the time when Ketanji Brown Jackson was confirmed as the next Supreme Court Judge by the Senate.

Historic moment for our courts and for our country. Congratulations, Judge Jackson. pic.twitter.com/eLSfs1QoHB — President Biden (@POTUS) April 7, 2022

Moreover, looking closely at the screengrab from the video we found that the television screen was morphed.

Therefore, it is clear that the viral video is edited. The actual video is not of White House celebrating the defeat of Imran Khan. But, they were celebrating the news of Ketanji Brown Jackson as next Supreme Court Judge. But, some users are posting edited video with the wrong claim.
