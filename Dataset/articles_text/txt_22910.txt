AFWA found that Sambit Patra had uploaded two pictures on February 13 at 12:16 am which said, "Since I was out of station yesterday I hoisted the @BJP4India flag at my home today... and a welcoming party sticker at the entrance to celebrate #MeraParivarBhajapaParivar. Urge All My friends to do the same!"

One of the two pictures with this tweet was the very picture of Sambit Patra sticking a poster saying, "Fir ek baar Modi sarkar [Modi government once again]."
