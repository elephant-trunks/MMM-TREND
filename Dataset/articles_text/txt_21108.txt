‘The Kashmir Files’, Vivek Agnihotri’s controversial film on the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus, has reportedly led to incidents of hate speech against Muslims. Amid this, a video has gone viral on social media.

This video was shared with the claim: “This is the effect of watching Kashmir Files. Muslims are under attack.”

The India Today Anti-Fake News War room (AFWA) found that this video had no connection with ‘The Kashmir Files’. This incident took place in Surat, Gujarat, and was not a hate crime. Ten out of the 11 accused in this case are Muslims.

AFWA PROBE

With the help of InVid and Reverse Search tools, we found a screengrab of the video used in a TV18 Gujarati news report from March 20.

Per the report, this CCTV footage captured anti-social elements attacking a shopkeeper who refused to pay a ransom. To further confirm the claim, we got in touch with Ajoy Tomar, the commissioner of Surat City Police. “It’s a ten-day-old incident and there was nothing communal about it. Both accused and victims belong to Hindu and Muslim communities,” Tomar confirmed to India Today.

An inspector from the local police station also confirmed to India Today that ten out of the 11 accused in this case were Muslims.

Hence, we can conclude that the claim along with this video is false. The incident has no connection with ‘The Kashmir Files’. Nor is it a hate crime.
