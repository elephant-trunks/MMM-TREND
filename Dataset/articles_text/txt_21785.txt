With the help of reverse image search, we found the original version of the image on the stock image site Getty Images. In this image, the men can be seen offering cake to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.

According to the information provided by Getty images, the image shows Indian Youth Congress supporters celebrating Gandhi's 37th birthday. The image was taken on June 19, 2007, in front of Congress party president Sonia Gandhi's residence in New Delhi.

The original image was also carried by a Times of India news report with credits to AFP on June 19, 2007. The title of the report reads, "Rahul Gandhi turns 37 today."

Hence, it is clear that the image of Congress workers feeding cake to Mia Khalifa's photo is morphed and is more than a decade old.
