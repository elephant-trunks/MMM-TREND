As the political crisis continues in Maharashtra, the nation is closely watching the manoeuvres of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance and the opposition BJP. Meanwhile, a tweet purportedly by the Press Trust of India (PTI) claimed that social activist Anna Hazare has threatened to go on a hunger strike if BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis is not appointed the next Maharashtra chief Minister.

One such post can be seen below.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the post to be misleading. The viral tweet was made by an imposter account. PTI didn't share the said information over their Twitter account.

The archived version of the post can be seen here and here.

AFWA Probe

We first checked whether Anna Hazare had made such a demand. But there were no reports of him making any statement on the Maharashtra crisis. The tweet also mentioned that Anna Hazare would stage a protest in front of the Mumbai Saki Naka railway station. But Saki Naka, located in Andheri East, has no railway station but a metro station.

We checked the viral tweet next. While the display name of the unverified page read 'Press Trust of India', the handle name was @ZackRhea. It had a total of 2,236 followers.

PTI's official handle, on the other hand, is verified and has over 3.8 million followers. We confirmed that the Twitter handle of this account is @PTI_News. Given below is a screenshot of the profile.

When searched on the Twitter search bar for the Press Trust of India, PTI's official handle shows the phrase "PTI! We bring the world to you..." Meanwhile, the word "parody" shows up below the handle that had tweeted the viral tweet.

Therefore, we conclude that Anna Hazare did not demand Devendra Fadnavis be made the next Maharashtra chief minister. The tweet that claims so was not made via PTI's official handle but a parody account.
