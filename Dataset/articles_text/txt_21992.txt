Amid protests by Opposition workers and farmers’ unions against the Centre’s agriculture reforms, West Bengal BJP chief and Lok Sabha MP Dilip Ghosh put out a picture on Twitter in support of his party and Narendra Modi.

The picture shows bunches of paddy saplings placed in a field in such a way that it reads “BJP” and “Modi”. Ghosh claimed the picture was taken in a village in Bengal’s South Dinajpur district and depicts farmers extending their gratitude to the Prime Minister.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the picture to be misleading. The photo was taken in Bihar’s Kaimur district in July this year.

Ghosh tweeted the picture on October 6 and wrote, “Picture taken from Puntor Village of Kumarganj assembly (Dakshin Dinajpur). Farmers of Bengal, extending their gratitude towards Hon’ble Prime Minister... #BJP4Farmers”

The tweet is also being shared on Facebook. The Twitter handle of West Bengal BJP has also retweeted Ghosh’s misleading tweet. The archived version can be seen here.

Using a reverse search, we found the viral picture in a photo gallery of “Outlook”. Here, the caption says: Farm workers put bunches of paddy saplings in a formation that reads “BJP MODI”, ahead of Bihar Assembly polls, in Kaimur district of Bihar.

The picture was credited to news agency PTI.

We also found the picture in the photo archive section of PTI. As per the news agency, it was taken on July 12 in Kaimur district of Bihar.

West Bengal has witnessed protests and counter-protests over the farm reform laws. While Trinamool Congress and CPI(M) took out rallies against the reforms, BJP held several “Krishak Suraksha Yatras” in support of the laws, assuring farmers that they’ll get a better price for their produce.

But it is certain that the picture tweeted by Dilip Ghosh is almost three months old and was taken in Bihar.
