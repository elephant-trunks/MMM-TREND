Apart from this, a longer version of this video is available on YouTube dated 2nd May 2017. The title of this video reads “7-D Show at Galata Tower”.

Pictures of Galata Tower are also available on Trip Advisor website. After this, we searched for Galata Tower, Istanbul Turkey on Google Map; the result of which you can see below. We noticed that it is the same tower which is shown in the viral video.

Similar light shows are often held at Galata Tower, and videos of many such light shows are available on YouTube which make it clear that the video is of the Galata Tower in Turkey and not from the light show in Chandan Nagar, West Bengal.

Conclusion: We have found the above post wrong after checking the facts. The light show shown in the video is from the 3D projection show at the Galata Tower in Istanbul. This video from the year 2017 and is from Istanbul, which is being falsely portrayed as Chandan Nagar in West Bengal.
