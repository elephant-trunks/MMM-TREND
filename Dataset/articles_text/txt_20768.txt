The Uttar Pradesh Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) entrance was cancelled following a paper leak. This news brought a lot of disappointment to the aspirants who had been wanting to sit for the exam.

Amidst this, a picture of people sleeping on the road is going viral on Facebook. According to users, the picture was taken outside a UPTET centre of the aspirants and aimed to highlight the ‘failure of the BJP government’.

Fact-Check:

However, after reverse searching the image, we found a tweet by UP Police calling this claim fake and attributing the picture to Rajasthan.

वायरल फ़ोटो UPTET के अभ्यर्थियों की नहीं है अपितु राजस्थान के युवकों की है। UPTET के परीक्षार्थियों को उनके एडमिट कार्ड के आधार पर सुविधापूर्वक यूपीएसआरटीसी की बसों से घर भेजा जा रहा है और यह परीक्षा राजकीय व्यय पर पुनः एक माह में आयोजित करायी जायेगी। कृपया भ्रामक खबर ना फैलाएँ। pic.twitter.com/gz41pdEjO4 — UPPOLICE FACT CHECK (@UPPViralCheck) November 28, 2021

Taking a queue from this we performed a keyword search along with the picture and found an article by Dainik Bhaskar which had used the same image on the article about unemployed youth who had come to meet Priyanka Gandhi and slept there to wait for here.

Since the image is not from a UP exam centre, this claim is misleading.
