A clip of Punjab’s CM Bhagwant Mann is getting viral on social media. The video claims that he has openly confessed that he is unaware of who is running the government.

In a Thirteen-second long video, Bhagwant Mann gave a speech in Punjab that translates,

“I don’t know what was done to make whom happy. But the thing that is not understandable is who is actually running the government! The scenario of the government is like a bus without a driver which can crash into any pit at any moment.”

People all over the internet are sharing his video sarcastically.

One person states, “Here, the change he has gone mad.”

Fact Check:

We reverse searched the video and found that the video is from the year 2017 when Congress was running the government. And he said it to attack the ruling party. The video plays at 13 minutes 07 seconds. He was questioned by a reporter to whose response he stated, “Please let me know (who is running the government) if you come to know. Nobody has any clue who’s actually running the government.” After the driverless bus jibe, he again takes a dig at Congress by saying, “Congress has lost all hopes as they know that they aren’t winning.”

Conclusion:

The video was the clipped part of the whole video, also it us from the year 2017.
