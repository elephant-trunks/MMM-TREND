The post, which appeared in 2018, read: “This is our future Prime Minister candidate, who doesn’t even know how to salute a national flag….Hey Mother India! What will happen to you?”

FACT-CHECK

Using the Google Reverse Image Search, we found the original photo used by NDTV on August 15, 2011 depicting the Independence Day event in New Delhi at the Congress Party headquarters. It was taken during unfurling of the national flag at the Congress office.

The facebook user Yogi Sena GKP (now deleted) has used the picture flipping it horizontally and entered the text as shown in the picture above.

See the difference above. Hence, the photo was not a real one, but flipped and altered to show Rahul Gandhi in a negative narrative.

Conclusion: False. A simple photo-editing technique has been used here to send out a wrong message to mislead people.
