Between 2015 and 2017, access to safe drinking water (as a percentage of the population) in the rural areas of Assam, Bihar, J & K, Jharkhand, Punjab, Telangana and West Bengal dropped, according to government data.

As much as 94% of India’s rural population had access to safe drinking water by August 2017.

While 71% rural population was fully covered (more than the norm of 40 litres/capita/day of safe drinking water), 23% was partially covered (less than the norm of 40 litres/capita/day safe drinking water).

Assam had provided 86% of its rural population with safe drinking water in 2017, followed by Punjab (75%), West Bengal (74%) and Tripura (73%).

Punjab saw the steepest decline, from 89.3% in 2015 to 75% in 2017. Tripura increased access from 55% in 2015 to 73% this year.
