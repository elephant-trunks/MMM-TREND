Spread the truth:

Yesterday a tweet was made from McDonald’s official handle calling Donald Trump disgusting and asking forBarak Obama.

Now this may not necessarily be a hack, a possibility is that the employee tweeted thinking it as his own account.

Twitter allows more than one account on it’s mobile App. One may miss which account he/she is on, tweeting on impulse.
