Has former Australian cricketer Ricky Ponting taken a dig at BCCI’s “money power” after the Men in Blue’s unceremonious exit from the T20 World Cup? At least that’s what several netizens are claiming.

India’s hopes of making it to the T20 semi-finals were lost after New Zealand beat Afghanistan by eight wickets in Abu Dhabi on November 7, 2021. A day later, India officially exited the tournament despite a comprehensive win over Namibia.

Soon after, a statement allegedly made by Ponting started circulating on social media. It says, “Even with so much control and hold over world cricket, India is out of the World Cup. Money can’t buy success and Pakistan have proved that.”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be baseless. Ponting has made no such comment.

Scanning the Internet, we could not find any news report with the said statement. Had Ponting made such a remark, it would have definitely grabbed media attention.

We also went through Ponting’s social media handles, but did not find any such statement either.

Ponting’s spokesperson has confirmed to “Reuters” that the Delhi Capitals coach hasn’t given any such statement.

Ponting has played 168 Tests and 375 ODIs, including 230 as captain. He retired from all formats of the game in 2013.

To sum it up, a fictitious statement is being circulated as Ponting mocking India’s early exit from the T20 World Cup.
