Abdullah Gul, son of Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) DG Hamid Gul, tweeted a video on August 10 targeting the Indian Army.

THE CLAIM

Linking it to the current situation of the Kashmir valley, Abdullah Gul claimed that the viral video is from Kashmir where a massacre has started.

In the video, one can hear the cries as people rescue the injured.

THE FACT

India Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the viral video is from South Kashmir's Kulgam town but the incident is around 10 months old.

The archived version of the post can be seen here.

Abdullah Gul shared the video with the caption in Urdu that roughly translates to, "Massacre started in Kashmir. This video has been sent by a Kashmiri sister. Quaid-e-Azam has ordered the army to march towards Kashmir. We are providing diplomatic, moral and political support."

Twitter handle @Timesofgaza also tweeted the same video with the caption, "Indian forces are brutally killing people in Kashmir during the lockdown."

By the time of filing the story, it was retweeted more than 1,100 times.

THE PROBE

We found a user who shared the original video of the incident under the comments section of Abdullah's tweet.

This took us to the video uploaded by the YouTube channel named "Kashmir news" on October 21, 2018.

The description attached to this video mentioned about the rising of the death toll in Kulgam.

To confirm the incident, we ran a search on the internet and found many media reports. As per the reports, during an encounter between security forces and militants in Kulgam, dozens of civilians got injured in a blast at the gunfight site.

Among them, seven lost their lives.

It is clear that the video shared by Abdullah Gul is not a latest video.
