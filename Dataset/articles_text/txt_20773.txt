Unseasonal #rains and #floods in Chennai, Tirupati and parts of Karnataka have made life very tough for people and animals. Prayers for safety and help🙏 Hoping these poor cows survive #TirupatiRains

Fact-Check:

Upon reverse searching the key frames of the video, we found that a number of news channels had reports on this incident already. According to a report from the Mexican daily La Jornada, the flood took place due to a meteorological phenomenon called ‘Hanna’ in July 2020 affecting areas such as San Blas and Compostela. The same video is posted along with the article.

Since the video is from Mexico and is a year old, this claim is false.
