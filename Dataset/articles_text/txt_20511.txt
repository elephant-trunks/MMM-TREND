Fact check

After reverse image search, we found that the image is from the article of The Sun in the year 2020. As per the article, the picture is of a soldier whose brother was martyred in war against the Taliban in 2008. His name is Pte Doherty and when he became the soldier after his brother, he burst out into tears. Hence proving that the image is not from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It is two years old.

Conclusion: the claim is misleading.
