Boris Johnson on July 7 resigned as leader of the Conservative Party following a slew of resignations from his top team. He remains interim Prime Minister of the United Kingdom until a new leader is chosen by his party. Amid this, a video of Johnson has gone viral with some unusual claims.

The claim alongside the video says that it shows him being interrogated by the police for allegedly breaking the law and misusing his position. One such post noted that “other countries and their investigation agencies must take a lesson from this.”

AFWA’s investigation found this video was a spoof of the British television series “Line of Duty” created by a political activist group.

At the end of the viral video, one can see “Led By Donkeys” written on the screen. When we searched YouTube, we found a shorter version of the same video uploaded by the channel Led By Donkeys on January 19. The channel later, on April 13, uploaded the full-length video that’s now viral. Led By Donkeys is a British political activist group critical of Brexit and Johnson.

Guardian in January 2022 uploaded a portion of the same video on its YouTube channel, reporting that this was a spoof of one of the episodes of the British police crime drama series, “Line of Duty”. The video was created by stitching together clips from the show and several videos of Johnson, one of which can be seen here.

In January 2022, “Line of Duty” writer Jed Mercurio also tweeted this video calling it “brilliant work” by the Led By Donkeys team.

It is thus clear that this video is a spoof created by an anti-Johnson, anti-Brexit group and does not depict an actual incident.
