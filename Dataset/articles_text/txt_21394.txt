Communal tensions flared up in the northeastern state of Tripura recently after some Hindu groups took out a rally against attacks on minorities in Bangladesh. It has been alleged that members of Vishva Hindu Parishad vandalised a mosque and some Muslim properties in Tripura's Panisagar.



Now, a video of a huge rally has gone viral on social media with the claim that this is how people in Kerala protested against the violence in Tripura.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading. The video was shot in January last year during a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Kerala's Mannarkkad.
