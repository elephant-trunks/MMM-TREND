Truth

The viral claim that has been floating around is false. The image is not of 75 Indian soldiers who were killed by China in Ladhak. When the viral photo was run through a simple reverse image search, it was found that the image is of CRPF soldiers who died in the Pulwama Attack. The search showed multiple articles by various publications that featured the viral photo in articles about the Pulwama Attack. The photo is of tricolor draped coffins of CPRF personnel who lost their lives in Pulwama terror attack during the wreath laying ceremony that took place at the CPRK camp in Budgam, Jammu and Kashmir on 15th February 2019.

Attached below are the screenshot and links of the articles featuring the original picture by “The Hindu” and “The Hindustan Times”.

A old photo of dead soldiers was going viral few weeks ago with the claim that it is images of coffins of soldiers martyred in Handwara, Jammu and Kashmir.
