French President Emmanuel Macron has come under criticism over his remarks on radical Islam after a teacher was beheaded on the streets of Paris. Amid this, a video of Macron having an egg thrown at his face as he is in conversation with some people is circulating on social media.

The claim along with the video says Macron was attacked for his remarks on Prophet Mohammad, and calls for a boycott of French products.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading. The video was shot in March 2017 in Paris days before the Presidential elections in France, when Macron was a candidate for the top post.

The video is being shared with similar claims on Facebook and Twitter. The archived version can be seen here.

Using related keywords, we found some media reports carrying a similar video of the event, shot from a different angle. A report by “Express” says Macron was attacked by a protester with an egg when he was attending an agriculture show in Paris in March 2017.

The incident was also covered by “rt.com” and “ETV Telangana” in 2017.

This was not the first time when Macron was egged. In 2016 too, an angry mob pelted eggs on Macron in Paris.

Therefore, it has been established that the video is more than three years old and has nothing to with Macron’s recent remarks on Islamic fundamentalism.

Why is Macron under attack?

As per “The Indian Express”, the remarks came at a ceremony for Samuel Paty, a teacher killed in Paris for showing cartoons of Prophet Mohammad in a class.

Macron had said the teacher “was killed as Islamists want our future”, and also pledged to fight against “Islamist separatism”. While defending free speech, he had also said that France “will not give up cartoons” depicting Prophet Mohammad.

These remarks triggered backlash from Muslim countries such as Turkey and Pakistan.
