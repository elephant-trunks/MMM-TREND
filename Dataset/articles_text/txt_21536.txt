Security was tightened across the country, and especially in Jammu and Kashmir, ahead of Independence Day celebrations. The last few days have seen several encounters between terrorists and security forces in the Valley.

On social media, a video of a man’s arrest is circulating with the claim that it shows Srinagar Police arresting a terrorist. The video shows a police jeep apparently knocking down a motorcycle and then a cop landing a flying kick at the rider and pinning him down.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is from Brazil and not Srinagar.

The archived versions of the posts can be seen here and here.

Reverse-searching keyframes from the video, we found it in a Portuguese news website called “ndmais.com”.

According to the news item dated August 2, 2021, the rider was chased by police patrolling the Perola area in Brazil’s Umuarama town. The 17-year-old was reportedly asked by police to stop the bike, but he was trying to escape. The bike collided with a police vehicle while taking a U-turn, and cops then apprehended the rider.

The same information can be found in several other websites and video articles by Brazilian media.

Some reports say the boy’s father was also booked for giving a vehicle to a minor.

From the available proof, it is clear that the video is not from Srinagar but Brazil.
