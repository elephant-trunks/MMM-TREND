A screenshot of ‘India TV’ has gone viral on social media with a claim that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said – ‘Free treatment was provided to one crore COVID-19 patients’. In the post, it is being questioned how the government could provide treatment for one crore COVID-19 patients if the number of patients was less than 2 lakhs in the country. Let’s fact check the claim made in the post.

The archived version of the post can be found here

Claim: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that free treatment was provided to one crore COVID-19 patients in India. Fact: In his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme, Modi has said that the beneficiaries of ‘Ayushman Bharat’ scheme crossed over one crore. He did not say that the government has treated one crore COVID-19 patients. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.

When searched about the claim made in the post, it was found that no such comments were made by Modi. It was found that Modi, in his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme, has praised the efforts of the government in combating the pandemic and took pride in sharing that the beneficiaries of ‘Ayushman Bharat’ crossed over one crore. The statements made by PM Modi in his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme regarding 1 crore Ayushman Bharat beneficiaries can be heard in this video at 18:03 sec. The same can be read in the transcript of his speech on the ‘PM INDIA’ website and in the tweet of ‘PMO India’.

Also, the ‘India TV Hindi’ has issued a correction regarding their mistake during the telecast

#Correction कल मन की बात के प्रसारण के दौरान ये खबर चली कि भारत में कोरोना के एक करोड़ मरीज़ों का इलाज हुआ। ये मानवीय भूल थी। हम साफ कर दें कि भारत में कोरोना मरीज़ों की संख्या इतनी ज्यादा नहीं है। इस गलती के लिए हमें खेद है। pic.twitter.com/7UmPFqYf6g — India TV Hindi (@IndiaTVHindi) June 1, 2020

To sum it up, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not said that his government provided treatment for one crore COVID-19 patients.
