Anti-Hindu violence broke out across Bangladesh following social media rumours of desecration of the Quran at a Durga Puja pandal in Cumilla. Several Hindus were killed and women were allegedly raped, as hundreds of Durga Puja pandals, temples, houses, and shops were vandalised by mobs over the past few days.

Amid this, a picture showing pages scattered on the floor has gone viral with the claim that this is how Hindus in Cumilla desecrated the Quran and urinated inside a mosque.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the image is five years old and not related to the recent violence in Bangladesh. A Muslim man was arrested for the said incident at a Cumilla mosque in 2016.

Using keyword search, we found the picture in some Bangladeshi news reports from October 22, 2019.

According to these reports, an image of desecration of the Quran in a Cumilla mosque had gone viral at the time, accusing Hindus for the same. The police in Bangladesh had then clarified that the incident and the viral image associated with it were from 2016 and there was no communal angle to it.

We found the original press note of Bangladesh police posted on October 21, 2019, on their Facebook page. As per the release, they had arrested a Muslim man named Jahangir Alam for his alleged involvement in desecrating the Quran at a mosque in Cumilla’s Brahmanpara locality in 2016. Police had alerted people regarding misinformation over the incident.

Police investigation did not find any involvement of Hindus in the 2016 incident.

Hence, it is clear that a five-year-old picture is being circulated, accusing Hindus of desecrating the Quran in Cumilla, Bangladesh, at a time the country is gripped in anti-minority violence.
