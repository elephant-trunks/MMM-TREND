A video of a traffic signal post getting swept away in floodwater is circulating on social media with the claim that this is a scene from Hyderabad after heavy downpour.

Heavy rains in Telangana, including in the capital Hyderabad, have claimed over 30 lives and caused an estimated loss of Rs 5,000 crore.

Amid this, a bizarre video of a traffic signal post floating down a waterlogged street has caught the attention of netizens. Many on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube claim that the video was shot in Hyderabad during the ongoing flood fury. The caption says, “First time in History. Signal crossing the road. #Hyderabad Rains”.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The viral video is two years old and from Yulin city of China.

The archived versions of the posts can be seen here, here, here and here. The video is being widely circulated on Facebook.

The clues

After carefully looking at the video, we found signboards in shops and a sticker on the back of a two-wheeler in Mandarin. This raised doubts about the viral claim.

Using InVID tool, we sliced up the video into keyframes and using reverse image search, found that the longer version of the video was uploaded by the YouTube channel of China Global Television Network (CGTN) on May 11, 2018.

The title of the video says, “Dramatic moment: ‘Walking’ traffic light gets swept down the flooded street in China”.

According to CGTN, the video, filmed in Yulin city of south China’s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, shows a temporary traffic light being swept down a street by floodwaters.

We found from Chinese media reports that 70,000 people were affected in Guangxi Zhuang due to heavy downpour in 2018.

The clipping went viral last year as well with false claims that it was shot in Mumbai during heavy downpour. The claim was debunked by other fact-checkers.
