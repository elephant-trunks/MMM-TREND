Spread the truth:

A small video clip of a Railway Engine parked in Vadodara loco shed, painted with advertisement of Fortune Brand Flour is viral relating it to ongoing farmer’s agitation.

The video is viral with following texts –

“Kishan bill sarkar vapas kyon legi ? jabki iski tayyari pahlese ho chuki he adani ke chakki aata ki ad indian railway ke engine pe lag chuki he”

“Now Railway is not Indian Property, It is adani s Railway’

“Sabhi desh wasiyo ko Adani railway 🚂🚃🚃🚃 ki taraf bahoot bahoot mubarak”

“Lo bhai adani ki rail bhi taiyar ho gayi …. aur kehte the k railway ka nijikaran nahi hoga …. worst days are cooming soon”

Twitter

Hardik Patel, Working President Gujarat Congress, tweeted the video with following text –

“भारतीय रेल पर अदानी के फ़्रेश आटे का विज्ञापन देखने लायक़ हैं। अब तो दावे के साथ कह सकते है की किसानों की लड़ाई सत्य के मार्ग पर हैं।”

Translation: “Adani’s fresh flour’s advertisement on Indian rail is worth watching. We can say with solid claim that farmer’s fight is on the track of the truth”

Truth

This video is merely an advertisement of a brand on Indian Railways Engine for revenue generation. This was started 7 years ago in 2013 with first brand being “Amul”.

Since 2013, many brands have advertised, with their brand on Locomotive Engines.

Since a train travels and crosses through various cities, being seen by thousands and lakhs of people, this was considered a good idea for revenue generation by Indian Railways.

Amul (2013) –

Sharon Plywood –

Tata Steel –

Haldiram –

Goel TMT –

Fortune Oil –

Porna Chicken –

The following video by “Railzone” shows many such brands on Engine

“Grappling with huge losses due to un-optimized advertising properties, the Indian Railway is now striving hard to revive their non-fare revenue schemes. As a first step the Indian Railways is reportedly expected to allow advertising on engines of different trains. As per news reports, the Railways have written to all states to use trains as their ad mediums to showcase their tourist spots, welfare schemes and other successful ventures.

Unlike coaches where flexes are allowed to be used, the engines will have only stickers as a branding. It may be noted that the Indian Railway has close to 13,000 trains running on a daily basis. They are currently charging Rs 1.98 lakh per year for branding products on an engine. The non-fare revenue is not even 5% of its total revenue of railways. Recently , the Railways also allowed for branding on freight trains.” Source – Media4Growth
