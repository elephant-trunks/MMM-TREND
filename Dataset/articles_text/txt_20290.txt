A picture of Russian President Vladimir Putin is becoming very viral on social media. In which he can be seen wearing a tight suit jacket. The picture claimed that Putin started wearing a bulletproof jacket after the Ukraine war.

Sharing the viral picture, a Twitter user wrote that Putin seems to have started wearing a bulletproof jacket.

This tweet has got more than 23000 likes. Also, hundreds of users have commented on this tweet. The user believes that this picture of Putin is from after the Russo-Ukraine war.

Fact Check:

To check the viral picture, we first did a reverse image search of this picture. From which it came to know about the picture that this picture was first published by the Russian outlet Kommersant on August 4, 2017.

Giving information about the picture, the Russian outlet wrote that this picture was taken by photojournalist Gleb Shchelkunov on August 4, 2017. When Putin reached Lake Baikal during his election campaign.

However, looking at the picture in general, it is not possible to determine whether the wrinkles on Putin’s suit came from wearing the bulletproof jacket underneath.

Conclusion:

Hence the claim made with the viral picture is misleading. Because this photo was taken not after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in May 2022, but during Putin’s election campaign on August 4, 2017.
