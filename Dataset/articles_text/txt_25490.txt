“A separate special edition stamp project which incorporates all the G20 Leaders has also been prepared by PTT. These stamps of all leaders have been compiled together in a bigger sheet in the memory of the summit. Each stamp has a picture of a leader along with the flag of his/her country. Together with the Leader’s personalized stamps, this corporate stamp sheet was presented to the Leaders by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President of the Republic of Turkey, after the last session of the Summit.

The number of printed personalized stamps of the leaders was limited to the number of leaders attending the Summit.”
