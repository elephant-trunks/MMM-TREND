Amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, an emotional video of soldiers hugging and kissing their dear ones has gone viral with the claim that they are Ukrainian soldiers bidding farewell to loved ones in Kyiv.

Several Twitter users shared this short video clip with captions like, “Damn war ... Here is the capital of Ukraine: scenes of anxiety, farewell, love ”

The India Today Anti-Fake News War room (AFWA) found this to be false. This video is a scene from a Ukrainian film called “The War of Chimeras”, released in 2017.

The viral posts are archived here and here.

With the help of the InVID tool and reverse image searches, we have found the same scenes from the viral clip matched with a couple of YouTube videos. A YouTube channel called Geomovies uploaded the trailer from the aforementioned movie. This contained the clip being shared.

The entire scene in the viral clip was also found on another YouTube channel, “ Production”. The YouTube channel contained detailed information about the video in the Ukrainian language that claimed these were select scenes from "The War of Chimeras".

“The War of Chimeras” is a Ukrainian movie directed by Anastasiia Starozhytska and Mariia Starozhytska. The film was produced in 2017.

The film follows war in eastern Ukraine and is narrated through the eyes of volunteer fighters.

Thus, we can conclude that the viral clip being shared has no connection with the ongoing crisis, rather it is a scene from a war film.
