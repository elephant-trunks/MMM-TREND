An old audio clip of mine is going viral on WhatsApp. It was recorded and released during the anti CAA agitation. Over the last few days, many friends have called / messaged me to confirm it was me and not Harish Salve, as many claimed. If you listen to it closely, at 1:34, i mention by name. Hope this clears the confusion.

A few months ago, a video of mine got credited to Justice Srikrishna, so much so that he had to issue a clarification that it was not him. I hope Harish Salve ji is not forced to undergo this trouble.
