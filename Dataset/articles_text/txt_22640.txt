India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this to be a misleading post. This earthquake video in Mexico is two years old.

Many Facebook users have posted the same video claiming that it is a recent earthquake in Mexico.

With the help of keyword search, we found that a devastating earthquake measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale had hit Mexico on September 7, 2017, which killed at least 61 people and left several hundreds injured.

Leading international media such as CNN had covered this calamity. During that time, Mexico was hit by two major earthquakes within two weeks.

We found a portion of the same video in a BBC news clip uploaded on September 20, 2017.

Mexico, however, was hit by a minor earthquake measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale on October 13, 2019. But there is no media report of a strong earthquake of 8.1 magnitude in recent times.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the video in the viral post in two years old, and hence, the post is misleading.
