With a surge in the novel coronavirus, or Covid-19, cases globally, social media platforms are flooded with weird home remedies.

A Facebook post along with a video claims one can overcome the novel coronavirus by hot air application from a hairdryer.

Several people have also forwarded this viral post on WhatsApp groups.

The nearly six-minute video claims this is a presentation by 'Dr Dan Lee Dimke, PHD'. According to him, hot air application through hairdryer on the face to heat up nostrils and sinus fights back the novel coronavirus. This video is also available on YouTube and its archived version can be seen here.

India Today Anti-Fake News War room (AFWA) has found the viral post to be misleading. There is no proven evidence that hot air application through hairdryer can cure the Covid-19.

We looked for the credential of Dr Dan Lee Dimke and found from his biography that he is not even a medical practitioner. Dr Dinke has a PhD in Education. He is a hypnotist and futurologist and a CEO of an internet information marketing firm called Future World.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has never mentioned any such hot air application remedy for the novel coronavirus in its public advice on Covid-19. The WHO guideline can be seen here.

International fact-check website 'Snopes' had earlier debunked this viral claim and also stated that using hot air application through a hairdryer on the face could be potentially dangerous.

AFWA had earlier debunked another viral home remedy which had said gargling with warm salt water can save you from the novel coronavirus.
