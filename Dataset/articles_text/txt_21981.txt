The three-decade-old conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region erupted once again last month. Both the countries accuse each other of violating ceasefire and shelling civilian areas.

Amid this, some netizens are sharing two pictures of heavily damaged defence equipment and claiming that they are the Russian-made S-300 air defence system of Armenia which was destroyed during attacks by Azerbaijan.

The caption along with the pictures says, "#BREAKING. AZERBAIJAN. Picture shows DESTROYED Russian Made S-300 Air Defence Systems of Armenia. Israeli made Harop Drones proved very effective against Russian Air Defence Systems."

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the pictures are at least four years old and not related to the recent Azerbaijan-Armenia clash. The weapons were destroyed in an accident in Russia.

The claim is being widely circulated on Facebook. The archived version can be seen here.

As per media reports, the viral pictures are old and related to an S-300 air defence system that was damaged in Russia in an accident. Reverse-searching the images, we found them in a Greek news article published on December 5, 2016. The report also has a YouTube video link of the incident that can be seen below.

According to another report published in science and tech website "Popular Mechanics", a Russian surface-to-air missile had crashed after its motor failed to ignite. It says that the incident took place at Ashuluk Firing Range, a missile base in southwestern Russia.

A Turkish website had also reported the incident.

Earlier, AFP had debunked a similar claim. Thus, it is clear that the viral images are old and not related to the ongoing fight between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
