Mumbai: "Hamari sarkare baar baar kyu aati hai? Gujarat mai hum 27 saal se shaasan me hai, Madhya Pradesh me 15 saal, Chhattisgarh me 15 saal se.. kyu baar baar sarkare ati hai.. development hi toh kaaran hai. Aur hum par aarop lagate hai ki hum communal party hai. Hamari sarkar banne ke baad, Gujarat me ek bhi danga nahi hua, Madhya Pradesh me ek bhi danga nahi hua, Chhattisgarh me ek bhi danga nahi hua. Uttar Pradesh me hamari sarkar banne ka baad dange band hue hai."

("Why do our governments return to power? In Gujarat, we have governed for 27 years, in Madhya Pradesh for 15 years, in Chhattisgarh for 15 years. Why do our governments return? Development is the main reason. And they accuse us of being a communal party. After our government was formed in Gujarat, not even a single riot took place. In Madhya Pradesh not a single riot occurred, in Chhattisgarh not a single riot occurred. In Uttar Pradesh, after our government was formed, riots have stopped.")

These were the claims made by Amit Shah, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on November 23, 2018, in an interview to Zee News.

Shah's claims are false.

Gujarat reported 35,568 riots from 1998 to 2016, according to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) Crime in India data and FactChecker research.

Madhya Pradesh reported 32,050 riots from 2003 to 2016, Chhattisgarh reported 12,265 riots from 2003 to 2016, and Uttar Pradesh reported 195 communal riots in 2017.

Claim: After our government was formed in Gujarat, not a single riot took place.

"From 2014, the data on riots is categorised into sub-heads, namely communal riots, industrial riots and riots for political reasons."
