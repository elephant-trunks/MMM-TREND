Did prime minister Narendra Modi claim that his government has built 10 houses for every Indian? However improbable it may sound, this is exactly what is being claimed on the basis of tweet by NDTV news channel.

Quoting a tweet by NDTV, many people are claiming on social media that PM Modi, during a rally in Uttar Pradesh's Raebareli on Dec 16 said "over 1,250 crore houses have been set up" under his rule.

India's population is around 125 crores. So 1250 crores new houses effectively means 10 houses for every Indian.

Over 1250 crore houses have been set up. People have celebrated Diwali in their new homes. The houses we make will have water, electricity, gas connections and toilets: PM Modi

India Today Fact Check team found the claim to be false. We found that PM Modi never mentioned 1,250 crore houses in his speech. He rather said that over 1.25 crore houses have been constructed.

Using this tweet, netizens started taking a dig at PM Modi, saying that he claimed a near impossible figure in context of houses built by his government.

Among many, the Scheduled Caste department of the Congress and party's national convener Ruchira Chaturvedi also retweeted NDTV's tweet and made sarcasm-dripping comments against PM Modi.

1250 crore houses for 600 crore voters. Only @narendramodi ji could have achieved this. https://t.co/1WjVIGVlB3 Ruchira Chaturvedi (@RuchiraC) December 16, 2018

1250 Crore houses for india?

10 houses for each indian? Even after defeat in 5 states, It seems Modi Ji has not learned any lesson and still doing Jumlebaazi. https://t.co/gB7Jzca2Q8 AICC SC Department (@INCSCDept) December 16, 2018

Side effect of losing election.

The tweet with the false figure has already been retweeted more than a thousand times.

When we listened to the full Raebareli speech, we found out that at 48 minutes and 52 seconds, PM Modi can be heard saying that "1.25 crore houses have been constructed under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana" and not 1,250 crore houses.

Later, NDTV corrected the figure within a few hours, in reply to the original tweet that went viral.

On Ruchira's tweet, some users also replied pointing out that it was a mistake by NDTV.
