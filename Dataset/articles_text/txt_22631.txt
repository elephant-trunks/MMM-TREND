With Haryana and Maharashtra going to polls on Monday, a screengrab of AajTak channel attributing a quote to Dushyant Chautala, founder of Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), is going viral on social media.

According to the screengrab in Hindi, Chautala has said he will support the BJP if needed. The viral post carries a photo of the JJP founder and the AajTak logo. The news is carried under the 'Breaking News' plate.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral photo is five years old. Chautala had issued the statement to AajTak during the Haryana state assembly election of 2014. At that time, he was a member of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), a prominent regional party in Haryana.

Facebook user Arav Back shared this misleading post on October 18 in a group called 'BJP Haryana'. This is not the official Facebook page of the BJP's Haryana unit.

With the help of reverse image search, we found a similar screengrab of AajTak saying INLD could support BJP.

Using relevant keywords, we found a YouTube video related to this news. The video was uploaded on the YouTube channel of AajTak on October 19, 2014. As per the video, just before the assembly election results in 2014, Dushyant Chautala had told AajTak that INLD could support the BJP if needed. The viral screengrab can also be seen in the YouTube video of AajTak.

After being expelled from the INLD in 2018, Dushyant, along with his father Ajay Chautala, founded JJP. The INLD, previously known as Haryana Lok Dal (Rashtriya), was founded by Dushyant's great grandfather Chaudhary Devi Lal, who served as the sixth deputy Prime Minister of India.

We scanned the Internet thoroughly but couldn't find any recent media report carrying such a statement by Dushyant Chautala. His recent statements show that he has been continuously attacking the BJP.

Regarding the viral statement, India Today also reached out to Dushyant's media advisor Deepkamal Saharan. He confirmed that Dushyant has not given such a statement.
