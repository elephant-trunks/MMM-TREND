Note: Top 5 countries by overall score and India.

The ranking assessed countries on 33 indicators across four areas of access to financial services between June 2016 and May 2017: country commitment, mobile capacity, regulatory environment, and the adoption of traditional and digital financial services.

The countries were chosen on two criteria: they have "committed to improving financial access and usage, and collectively they represent a diverse range of geographies, cultures, and political and economic systems", according to the first report in 2015.

Kenya has topped the ranking every year since 2015.
