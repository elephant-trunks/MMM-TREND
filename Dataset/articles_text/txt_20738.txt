A picture is becoming massively viral on social media. In which a policeman can be seen pulling a man by the hair. It was claimed with the picture that this picture is from the tenure of Mulayam Singh Yadav. In which the saints were insulted by pulling them from the hair.

The user tweeted that there was no jihadi pulling the hair of our saints, friends of Up, he was the father of akhilesh yadav, so remember when he came to ask for votes after 3 months..!! @yadavakhilesh @samajwadiparty @samajwadiparty @SamajwadiParty_ @SamajwadiPartyM

On checking this picture, we found that this picture is not from the tenure of former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav but from Gujarat. At that time Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.

Upon further investigation, it was found that the photograph was taken on November 27, 2009, during the Gujarat Police visit to Asaram Bapu’s ashram and his “disciples”. Where this action was described as an attack by the Gujarat Police. Apart from this, a video report published on Aaj Tak’s YouTube channel on November 30, 2009 also showed similar views.
