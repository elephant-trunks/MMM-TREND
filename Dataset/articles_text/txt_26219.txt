The video is massively going viral on social media platforms.

Fact check

After cross-checking the claim, we found the original video of the viral performance. Under the “5, UNFORGETTABLE & AMAZING Britain’s Got Talent Auditions You MUST WATCH!” the video was posted in the year 2021. The boys sang an English song in the original video and not the song of Ramayana. Therefore the video is fake as it is edited with a different song. The claim is misleading as the performance is from Britain’s Got Talent and not from an American show.

Here is the song of Ramayana which is used in the viral video.

Conclusion: Hence proves that the claim is misleading.

Claim review: two boys have sung the title song of Ramayana on the stage of Britain’s Got Talent
