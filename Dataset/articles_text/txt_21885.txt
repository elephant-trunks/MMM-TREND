An image of a Shah Rukh Khan lookalike has gone viral on social media with the claim that this is a boy from Kashmir resembling the Bollywood Badshah.

Several Facebook users have posted the picture with the caption, “Kashmiri boy is making rounds on Social media who looks Like as Bollywood Badshah Shah Rukh Khan”.

Some websites have also published the image with the same claim.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that this is not an image of a Kashmiri boy who looks like Shah Rukh Khan. The viral image is an edited version of SRK’s photograph created through FaceApp, a mobile application for photo editing using artificial intelligence.

The viral image

We contacted Aabid Mir Magami, a Twitter user who’d posted the viral image with the same claim. According to his Twitter bio, Magami is a Kashmiri social activist and local Youth Congress leader.

Magami told India Today that he had no idea about the viral post, but since it was circulating on social media, he’d posted it. “I am also trying to find the Kashmiri boy who looks like SRK, but haven’t found him yet,” he said.

Several people raised suspicions on the claim and insisted the picture was edited using FaceApp. Taking this as a cue, we used FaceApp to alter an image of SRK available on the Internet.

We used the “teenage” filter on the SRK image and found it is similar to the viral image.

We tried this app again on an image of actor Hrithik Roshan. Using the same “teenage” filter, we received the following result.

Since none of the users or websites making the claim could provide details about any Kashmiri boy who looks like Shah Rukh Khan, and with FaceApp giving us a similar result as the viral image, we can conclude that the picture in circulation is not of a doppelganger of the Bollywood actor, but rather his edited photograph.
