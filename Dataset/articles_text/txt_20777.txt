Several known troll accounts on Twitter have posted the claim that Up government’s unemployment rate was 17.5 % in 2017 before Yogi Adityanath’s government.

The claim was posted by Rishi Bagree, who is known to post fake news and misinformation a lot. The claim was then subsequently picked up by many users who used the ‘copy paste’ format to post the same information.

Fact-Check:

Since the data cited in the tweets are from CMIE (Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy) , we went through their archives to find their data on unemployment rate in 2017. It must be noted that Yogi Adityanath took over the government in March 2017. As per CMIE data the unemployment rate in UP was actually 2.4% before Yogi’s government took over.

Previously, the highest ever unemployment rate reported by UP stood at 18.0% in June 2016 followed by 17.1% in August 2016 under the Akhilesh Yadav government, which was followed by a gradual reduction through 2016 and early 2017.The highest rate of unemployment in Uttar Pradesh under the BJP government since it came to power in 2017 stood at 21.5%, in the month of April 2020, followed by 20.4% in May 2020 owing to the lockdowns.

In May-August 2021, rise in unemployment percentage according to CMIE is 3.75% to 4.84%.

Therefore, the rate of unemployment under Yogi Adityanath’s government has actually increased since 2017. Hence, this claim is misleading.
