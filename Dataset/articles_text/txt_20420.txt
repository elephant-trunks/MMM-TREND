A picture is circulated on social media sites with a claim that a Muslim guy is beating a traffic police officer.

Pushpendra kulshreshta , a Facebook user shares a picture that writes, “Be independent, stay organized. Never rely on the police for security. Watch this attitude carefully. The picture is of the Ghantaghar area of ​​Jodhpur.. Orders to remove the encroachment, But when action was taken on the carts standing in disarray, the jihadis surrounded and this behavior happened with the police constable. The policeman is a traffic constable, named Shobharam. It is enough to be afraid that the attitude he is showing and the people standing around him … belong to the dear special-72 community of the government.

Where is this courage coming from? Because of its religious belief? Or because of its strong social shield….? One-way voting? These are only 8% in Rajasthan

It is known that even if this constable is killed, this system cannot spoil it in any way.”(Translates Hindi)
