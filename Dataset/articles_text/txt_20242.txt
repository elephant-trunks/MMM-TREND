Fake news and misinformation keep spreading on social media. Not only social media users are involved in spreading this fake news but also the mainstream media. A misleading video was shown in the news by ABP News regarding the Kanpur riots, whose fact check has been done by DFRAC with the headline – “Fact Check: ABP News and BJP leader shared an old video of 2020 as Kanpur riots”.

At the same time, a piece of information was circulated from the verified and official Twitter handle of the news channel “Zee Hindustan”. “Zee Hindustan” tweeted – ““जुमे की नमाज के बाद देवबंद में हंगामा!”
