An emotional post has gone viral on social media, showing a woman in police uniform posing with an elderly lady holding a food platter in her hands.

The claim

The post claims that the policewoman is the granddaughter of the old lady who has to wash utensils to make ends meet in widowhood.

The fact

But it's a fake, as India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found out.

AFWA found that the whole story with the photo is cooked up. There is no relationship between the policewoman and the old lady. Therefore, the claim that the old woman has worked so hard to secure the future of her granddaughter is also false.

Social media users are all praise for the old lady, assuming the claim to be true.

The probe

A simple reverse search revealed the truth behind the photo. As per the media reports, the lady in police uniform is Manvi, a constable in Sant Kabir Nagar district in Uttar Pradesh. Manvi made the headlines by her act of humanity which she showed by helping an old hassled woman. This is nearly a five-month-old incident which was even praised by UP Police DGP OP Singh.

The DGP's letter says Manvi had gone to a bank where she met an old woman who was starving and struggling with her work. Manvi helped the elderly woman in completing her task at the bank and offered her food.

India Today tried to contact Manvi but was unable to reach her. The response once received will be updated in the story.
