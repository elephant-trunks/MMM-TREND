Salute to the women’s power of the country.”

Other facebook user writes, “Many Congratulations.”

Fact Check:

We at DFRAC reverse searched the image to know the authenticity of the picture of Seema getting lot of attention from social media users. We found that any available i nformation about her on the internet does not mention anything in line with the claim.

Also, no such lists are announced by any recognized channels. Channels like BBC , TIME , Forbes , etc release a list every year that consists of “100 Women of the year.” Which shows all the talented and efficient women in different fields.

In these lists too Seema was not recognized.

Conclusion:

The news is fake as there is no such list and also the name of Seema is not available in any recognized list.

Claim Review: Nirbhaya Lawyer Seema Samridhi Kushwaha gets featured in the list of talented women.

Claimed by: social media users.

Fact Check: fake.
