The derogatory remark of the ex-BJP member Nupur Sharma against Prophet Mohammed is getting condemned all over the World. A trend #BoycottIndianProducts is trending on social media. Meanwhile, a piece of news is getting viral that Oman’s Grand Mufti Ahmed Al-Khalili has called for the #BoycottIndianProducts.

Many media reports including ARY News have published the articles with the same claim.

Moreover, many Indian media houses like News24, Hindustan Times, Reddit, and Times of India have claimed that Ahmed Al Khalili has started the trend of boycotting Indian Products.

Fact Check

In our analysis, we checked the official Twitter account of @AhmedHalKhalili. We found a tweet in which he strongly criticized the ongoing matter and asked all Muslim to rise as one nation.

He tweeted in Arabic which can be nearly translated into English, “The insolent and obscene rudeness of the official spokesman for the ruling extremist party in India against the Messenger of Islam, peace be upon him, and his pure wife, Mother of the Believers Aisha, may God be pleased with her, is a war against every Muslim in the east and west of the earth, and it is a matter that calls for all Muslims to rise as one nation.”

The noteworthy thing is that there is no mention of the boycott of Indian Products in any of his Tweets.

Conclusion

Therefore, the claims of media houses that Oman’s grand Mufti have started the trend #BoycottIndianProducts is deceptive.
