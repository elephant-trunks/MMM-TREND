Imran Khan was removed from the position of Prime Minister by using a no-confidence motion against him and Shahbaz Sharif became the new Prime Minister of Pakistan. After the incident, much news has evolved on social media regarding it.

@russia_urdu posted a picture of a protest site where he claimed that people are protesting against the US for showing support to the opposition party in Pakistan for a change in the regime of Turkey.

Many other users also spread the same picture where people are holding the picture of Imran Khan and on the other hand, an appeal for not involving other countries in the personal matter is written.

Fact check

After cross-checking the claim, we found the same picture on AFP. The picture was of 15 June 2017 when citizens of Turkey were protesting against the imprisonment of one of its MP’s in Istanbul.

After looking at the picture we can conclude that the picture was edited and it is an old picture of a protest site in Turkey.

Conclusion: therefore the claim is misleading.

Claim review: A fake picture of a Protest site in Turkey against the US is getting viral
