The Noida international airport is spread over more than 1,300 hectares of land. The construction of the first phase of the airport, which is expected to be completed by 2024, is being done at a cost of over Rs 10,050 crore.

However, the viral picture is not the model design of Noida international airport. It is the Beijing Daxing International Airport in China.
