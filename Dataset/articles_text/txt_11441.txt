Fact Check-

We started our investigation by searching about cocaine on WHO’s website. According to World Health Organization (WHO)’s website, they denied that cocaine can protect against the coronavirus. The website mentioned, “Cocaine is a stimulating and addictive drug. Its consumption causes serious side effects and is detrimental to people’s health.”

Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?

World Health Organization (WHO) report says, “Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) says that “currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)” and “no specific antiviral treatment recommended” for the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19. And the World Health Organization said specifically that smoking and “taking self-medication” are not recommended as coronavirus remedies.

Conclusion– Fact Crescendo found the above-mentioned post to be False. There is still no vaccine or medical treatment available or discovered for COVID-19. Cocaine certainly is not a cure for Coronavirus as it is a stimulant and addictive drug.
