Lars Vilks, the controversial Swedish cartoonist who had drawn caricatures on Prophet Muhammad, was killed in a car crash on October 3 near the southern Swedish town of Markaryd.

Soon after, a video of a burning vehicle has gone viral on social media with the claim that this was the accident that killed Vilks. Several Facebook users posted a five-minute video of piled vehicles and people trying to douse a burning car.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video has nothing to do with Vilk’s death. It is of a different road accident that took place in Russia’s Udmurtia in 2014. Nine cars had collided on a highway leading to one death.

Using InVID and reverse image search, we found that the video has been circulating on Russian websites and social media platforms since 2014.

We found a longer version of the video uploaded on a Russian YouTube channel in October 2014. The video description tells about a road accident that took place on September 21, 2014.

Taking this as a clue, we searched the Internet using keywords and found a Russian news report published on September 22, 2014, about the same accident.

As per the report, a terrible accident took place in the Central Russian republic of Udmurtia on September 21, 2014. Nine cars had collided on the Izhevsk-Mozhga highway, and one driver was killed after his vehicle caught fire.

Vilks and his controversies

Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks came into the limelight in 2007 after creating a controversial cartoon of Prophet Muhammad, depicting him with the body of a dog. He faced life threats after this and has since lived under police protection.

The 75-year-old cartoonist died on October 3 while travelling in a police car that collided with a truck near Markaryd town in Sweden. Two police officers accompanying him were also killed. The case is under investigation now.
