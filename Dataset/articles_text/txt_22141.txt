India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the incident took place not in a DM’s office, but in the office of a sub-divisional officer (SDO) in Haryana’s Munak village. Three persons were arrested in connection to the incident.

The archived versions of the Facebook posts can be seen here and here. Multiple Facebook users have shared the post.

We found that the incident was reported by multiple news websites on July 23, 2020, when the CCTV footage went viral on social media.

According to news reports, a power line was being laid at Gagsina village in Haryana’s Karnal district.

Some villagers went to the SDO of Munak electricity department with the complaint that the line that was being laid passed under their farmland. The SDO took the matter into consideration and informed the contractor that the plan was incorrect and asked him to change it. But while they were discussing the matter, five people entered the SDO’s office and started thrashing the villagers.

As per the in-charge of Gharaunda police station, three men were arrested and a case was registered against five for an incident of violence at Munak electricity department. Hence, the brawl caught on camera, wherein two men were being thrashed inside an office, took place in an SDO’s chamber in Haryana and not in a DM’s office.
