China has been a constant ally of India’s arch foe Pakistan. Apart from investing heavily in Pakistan and repeatedly defending it in international forums, China and India have been involved in border stand-offs.

In this context, a post is going viral on social media with the claim that as the main importer of Chinese goods, India should stop all trade ties with Beijing. The post goes on to give an example that Japan has refused to import even a needle from US as a mark of patriotism as Americans had nuked Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that both the claims are false. Japan was America’s fourth largest goods export market in 2018. Also, India is the seventh highest importer of Chinese goods; US tops the list.

The misleading claim was made by Facebook page Dekh Bhai’ on August 25. The archived version of the post can be seen here.

This post has been viral on social media since 2017 and shared by many users.

AFWA probe

Upon checking the website of United States Trade Representative, AFWA found that the US exported goods and services worth an estimated $120.4 billion to Japan in 2018, whereas its imports from the island nation stood at an estimated $177.1 billion during the same year.

If we talk about 2019, the United States Census Bureau website says that till June 2019, the US exported goods of approximately $37 billion to Japan

The post also claims that India is the main importer of China. But as per a Statista report, US is the largest importer of China with a 19.2 per cent share in China’s total export, while India’s share is 3.1 per cent and it is ranked seventh.

Therefore, the claims that Japan stopped import of US goods and India is China’s main importer are incorrect.
