Congress President Sonia Gandhi has been recently issued a third summons for questioning by the Directorate of Mountains (ED) in the money laundering case and has been asked to appear before it. Congress has staged protests across the countryagainst this.

In this regard, Zee News ran a news on the basis of a video clip and claimed that Sonia Gandhi while responding to the summons said, ‘I am Indira ji’s daughter-in-law, I am not afraid of anyone’

Fact Check:

Source: The Indian Express

To verify the above claim, DFRAC converted the video clip into multiple keyframes with the help of the InVID tool. On the reverse image of the keyframe, we found a video report by The Indian Express dated December 08, 2015, titled “I am Indira Gandhi’s daughter-in-law. I am not afraid of anyone. I am not worried.”

Apart from this, another report of NDTV was found. In which it was told that in a special conversation with NDTV in the National Herald case, Sonia Gandhi said,“In the morning your colleague asked me if I was afraid. I replied that I am the daughter-in-law of Mrs. Indira Gandhi and I am not afraid of anyone or anything.”

Conclusion:

So the news by Zee News about Sonia Gandhi is misleading .
