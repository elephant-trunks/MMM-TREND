A small clipping of a beautiful waterfall is being widely shared on social media with the claim that it is the Bhedaghat waterfall in Jabalpur district of Madhya Pradesh. Many have compared it with Niagara Falls, the global tourist destination along the United States-Canada border.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is of Jog Falls in Shimoga district of Karnataka. Located around 400 km from Bengaluru, Jog Falls is one of the highest waterfalls in India.

Many users have said in the comment section of the viral post that it is the Jog Falls and not the Bhedaghat waterfall. Using InVID and reverse search, we found videos of the same waterfall, shot from a different angle, on the YouTube channels of “The Hindu” and “Loksatta”.

According to these YouTube channels, the video is from Jog Falls. We further searched the Internet using relevant keywords and found that similar videos were uploaded as Jog Falls by netizens since 2019. The oldest video we could trace back was from August 8, 2019.

We also searched for images of Jog Falls and the Bhedaghat waterfall (also known as Dhuandhar waterfall) on Google. The Google images of Jog Falls matched with shots from the viral video.

However, the Google images of the Bhedaghat waterfall were different.

While the height of Jog Falls is 253 metres (830 feet), that of Bhedaghat waterfall is only 30 metres (98 feet). Therefore, it can be concluded that the viral clip is of Jog Falls in Karnataka and not the Bhedaghat waterfall in Madhya Pradesh.
