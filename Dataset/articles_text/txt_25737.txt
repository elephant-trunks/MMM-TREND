Bangladesh’s Sylhet has witnessed the heaviest floods in 122 years, affecting millions of people and disrupting day-to-day life. Against this backdrop, a video — showing a motorbike being washed away in an inundated street — is widely shared on social media, linking it to the Sylhet floods.

The video is shared on Facebook with a Bengali caption: “#আহ্ বন্যা… আহ্ জিন্দেগী …! #সিলেটের করুণ অবস্থা….! #আল্লাহ হেফাজত করুন …!” (English translation: # Ah Bonya… Ah, Zindagi…! # The miserable condition of Sylhet….! #God protect…!)

Here’s the link to the above post.

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim, and found it to be FALSE.

Doing a simple Reverse Image Search, we found a news report published by NDTV, dated August 10, 2016, which carried visuals similar to the viral video. The headline reads: “Heavy rain lashes Rajasthan, several districts flooded.”

The same video was also uploaded on a YouTube Channel on August 10, 2016, with the description: “Heavy Rainfall in Jodhpur (sun city), Rajasthan. A bike being washed away with a man. A bike floating in the water due to heavy rainfall.”

Thus, it is evident from the above information that an old video is falsely linked to the recent floods in Sylhet.
