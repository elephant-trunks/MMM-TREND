A video of a child’s kidnapping has been shared widely on social media. In the video, a niqab-clad woman approaches a child and touches his shoulder — supposedly pricking him with a narcotic-laced pin. As soon as the child faints, an autorickshaw arrives. Its driver and the woman carry the child into the vehicle.

People on Facebook shared the video and appealed to others to remain alert and save children from gangs who kidnap children.
