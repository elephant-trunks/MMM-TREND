Police on Saturday lathicharged protesting farmers in Haryana’s Karnal, on a day chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar was holding a meeting in the town with other BJP office-bearers. Images of farmers with blood-stained clothes and a controversial video of the Karnal SDM asking police to “crack the heads” of protesters drew wide condemnation on social media.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the picture to be misleading. The image was taken in 2013 after a terror attack in Srinagar.

Using reverse image search, we found the same picture in the archive section “The Indian Express”, with credits to PTI. According to the description, the picture is linked to a terror attack near Srinagar’s Iqbal Park.

The picture was taken on September 23, 2013.

According to media reports, on the morning of September 23, 2013, two CISF jawans were shot point-blank by terrorists at a market near Srinagar’s Iqbal Park when they went shopping. One of the jawans succumbed to injuries.

A similar picture was also carried by stock image site Alamy.

Therefore, it is clear that though several farmers sustained injuries in the police lathicharge in Karnal, the picture being circulated is eight years old and was taken after a terror attack in Srinagar.
