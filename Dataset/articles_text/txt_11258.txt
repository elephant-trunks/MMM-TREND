Fact Check-

On observing the video carefully we found a man holding a placard which clearly mentions “Justice George Floyd” which indicates that the video must be old and unrelated with the recent demonstrations at the Capitol Hill.

We started out investigation by running a keyword search on Google which led us to the same video uploaded on 4th of June 2020 on the website of global news. According to the website the video shows cosplayers lending their support to anti-racist protests in America by dressing up as superheroes such as Batman and Spiderman. The report further mentions that the man who dressed up as Batman was at the protests in Philadelphia. The man dressed as Bucks County Batman was identified as Bob Gade.

Next, we found another news report by The Philadelphia Inquirer which mentioned that Bob Gade went to the Philadelphia City Hall on May 30, 2020 to lend his support to the protest. Upon searching for Bob Gade’s account we came across his official Instagram account which posted the same video on May 31, 2020.

Conclusion- Fact Crescendo has found that the viral post above is False. The viral video showing a man in a Batman costume is not related to the recent protests in Capitol Hill. The video is from a ‘Black Lives Matter’ demonstration that took place in May 2020 in Philadelphia.
