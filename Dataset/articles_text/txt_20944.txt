ऊँची इमारतों का जिक्र अगर आज इतिहास के आधार पर करें तो सिर्फ़ कुतुबमीनार का ही गुणगान किया हैं जबकि कर्नाटक में स्थित भगवान भोलेनाथ का मुरूदेश्वर मंदिर जिसकी ऊंचाई 249 फीट है और कुतुबमीनार की ऊँचाई 238 फीट ही है। ऐसे इतिहास का क्या फायदा फैसला आपके हाथ में हैं !! pic.twitter.com/qAwcxkvM4B — Nikhil Aggarwal (Modi Ka Parivar) (@iNikhilAgg) September 10, 2021

Same claim on Facebook

Fact-Check : Upon trying to find out whether the height of this gopuram was really 249 ft, we searched the claim on Google. We found numerous credible sources that established the fact that the height of the gopuram is infact 237 feet and not 249ft.

Additionally, the height of Qutub Minar is indeed 238 ft.

Therefore, this claim is fake.
