India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The video is from Chittoor district in Andhra Pradesh. The man in the video had allegedly raped a girl studying in Class 5 on November 24 after luring her to a nearby field.

A Facebook page named 'Trinayana' posted the 2-minute-11-second video, which has been viewed almost 5.3 lakh times and shared more than 12,000 times till the filing of this story. The claim in Bengali says police are thrashing one of the men behind the Telangana horror. It sought to hang the guilty.

We reverse searched the viral video with the help of InVID Google Chrome tool and found an article published in 'The Hindu' on November 27 about the incident.

We also found the YouTube link of a Telugu news channel called NTVTelugu showing the same video. The Telugu caption of the video can be translated to, "A man who raped a 10-year-old girl has been thrashed by police."

In the Telangana rape and murder case, four men - one truck driver and three helpers - were nabbed from their houses. The viral video has no connection to the incident.
