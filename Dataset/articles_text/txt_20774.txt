Fact-Check:

Upon reverse searching the image on Google, we were immediately greeted with thousands of images and reports on the new Beijing Daxing Airport.

We found a report on the airport by the BBC using the same exact image.

This is blatant misuse of the image giving a false image to the masses. Therefore, this claim is misleading,
