India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading. The incident took place in August last year and has no relation to Eid celebrations.

Verified Twitter user "David Vance" posted the video on May 25 with a sarcastic caption saying, "Delightful street scene in Birmingham as #EidMubarak is celebrated with great joy." His tweet was liked by more than 8,700 users and retweeted almost 5,000 times till the filing of this story. The archived version can be seen here.

Some users captioned the video as, "#Ramadan and #EidAlFitr such a wonderful peaceful time in #islam for #muslims in #sparkbrook #Birmingham here". The misleading post is viral on Facebook as well.

AFWA investigation

With the help of keywords, we found some news reports by international media houses on the incident. According to Mirror, the fight broke out on August 15, 2019, on Prestbury Road in Aston, Birmingham.

Citing social media posts, the report says the mass brawl involved "two feuding families". However, the exact reason for the violence was not known.

A report by Daily Mail says the fight was a result of a bitter argument between two women at a wedding a few days ago.

Therefore, it is established that the video is old. It is being circulated with the misleading claim that the brawl in broad daylight took place on Eid.
