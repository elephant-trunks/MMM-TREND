A video of a lady complaining is being shared on social media with a claim that she is the Delhi IAS officer, who walked her dog at Delhi stadium. The post claims that this was her reaction after finding out that she has been transferred to Arunachal Pradesh, while her husband has been transferred to Ladakh.

The Facebook post reads: “सड़ जी की चहेती, कुत्ते वाली IAS मैडम ट्रांसफर आर्डर मिलने के बाद….खिलाड़ियों को स्टेडियम खाली करा कुत्ता घुमाने वक्त शर्म नहीं आई थी इन पढ़े लिखे जाहिलो को…?”

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the post, and found it to be false.

While analysing the video carefully, we noticed the text ‘Native Media PK beside the Twitter logo at the bottom right corner. We scanned through their Twitter page and found the original video which was posted on May 24, 2022.

The Urdu caption can be translated into English as: “1/2 #PakistanNeedsStability

Today the team #NativeMedia asked people for their opinion on how they view the kind of #Sexist remarks that @ImranKhanPTI passed in the Multan meeting. The majority opinion will be uploaded tonight. Here is a sample of #InternalizedMisogyny. Full video link: https://youtu.be/9_W_XRnef4I”

The 4:31-minute video was also published on their YouTube channel. In the video, she is saying that she supports Imran Khan. The viral clip has been taken 1 min 48 sec of the video, where she was talking about a police raid on the house of the daughter-in-law of Pakistani poet Allama Muhammad Iqbal, former justice Nasira Iqbal.

Hence, from the above fact-check it is clear that the video of a lady from Pakistan is being shared with false claims.
