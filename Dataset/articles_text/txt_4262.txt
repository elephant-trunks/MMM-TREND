Shameful that TMC members are desecrating the National Anthem in the presence of @AITCofficial Ex MLA; Purna Chandra Bauri of Raghunathpur Assembly of Purulia & other leaders.

Also, unfurling TMC flag in place of National Flag to celebrate Republic Day is extremely unfortunate. pic.twitter.com/8PlwsEWHYT
