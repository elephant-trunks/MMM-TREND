Amid the ongoing pre-monsoon floods and landslides in Assam, social media too has been inundated with videos and photos of the massive destruction. Amid this, a video of a man sleeping on a mattress while floating on muddy waters was widely shared with the claim that it was from Assam.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found this video was not from Assam, or even from India. It was shot during a January 2021 flood in Johor Bahru, Malaysia.
