In our fact check analysis we found this news misleading. The woman in the controversy was identified as Mariam Naji. She took to her Twitter account and denied the claims. @Mariam1597 tweeted, “The truth is the manager is British, not IndianNaji, Naji, Indian,Indian,”

The truth is the manager is British not indian 🙏🏼 https://t.co/QBIb4eO71J — Mariam naji 👁🇧🇭 (@Mariam1597) March 27, 2022

Further, we found that the owner of the restaurant is Indian but the manager who denied the entry was British. But, some media houses are giving a Hindu-Muslim angle to this. Although Marium Naji has denied the wrong fact related to this incident. When @ashoswai cross-questioned on her tweet and as her, what’s his name? She replied, “The British Manager named Llyod and I want to mention that I’m Muslim and I don’t like racism because God’s land is big. It can handle all of us. I hope we live in peace pls stop doing this I told you he’s British &I can identify the person if he is an Indian or not.”
