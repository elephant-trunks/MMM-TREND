A picture of some men performing Islamic prayers inside a room is circulating on social media as visuals from a Youth Congress office inauguration in Karnataka. The portraits of Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi can also be seen in the background.

Sharing the picture, many netizens posted a cryptic message saying such acts of the Opposition force people to turn away from them.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the image to be misleading. The picture was taken on January 31 at an event where Youth Congress leader Mohammed Haris Nalapad took over as president of the Karnataka unit. Apart from Islamic prayers, havan was also performed.

Using reverse image search, we found similar pictures uploaded by the official Twitter handles of both Karnataka Youth Congress and Nalapad on January 31. However, these tweets also carried an image of Nalapad attending havan.

Also, according to these tweets, the images are from the Karnataka Youth Congress office at the Congress House in Bengaluru.

Congratulating Nalapad, other Congress leaders also shared similar images of havan on their social media handles.

We did a further keyword search and found the image of Nalapad participating in havan in an article by “The New Indian Express” published February 1.

“Youth Congress leader Mohammed Haris Nalapad attends a havan after taking charge as KPYCC president in Bengaluru on Monday,” says the picture caption.

On January 31, Nalapad’s father and Shanti Nagar MLA NA Haris had posted videos of the Youth Congress leader performing both havan and Islamic prayers at the event.

Multiple other YouTube channels had also uploaded videos of the havan.

Hence, it is clear that apart from Islamic prayers, a havan was also held at an event where Youth Congress leader Mohammed Haris Nalapad took over as president of the Karnataka unit.
