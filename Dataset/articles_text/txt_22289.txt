In a scathing critique of the Delhi High Court's judgment suspending the sentence of Kuldeep Sengar in the Unnao rape case, Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave termed the order 'perverse beyond imagination'. Speaking to India Today's Preeti Choudhry, Dave expressed his deep disillusionment with the judiciary, revealing his decision to 'quit law in July 2025' after 48 years of practice. The High Court suspended Sengar's sentence on the grounds that he was not a 'public servant' under Section 5 of the POCSO Act at the time of the offence. Dave argued that an MLA is a person in authority and trust, making the judgment legally unsustainable and a shock to the collective conscience. He also drew parallels with the Aravalli verdict, warning that such rulings erode public faith in the justice system.
