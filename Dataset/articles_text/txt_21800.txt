Amid the ongoing battle between farmers agitating against the three farm laws and police in Delhi, an image of a man wearing a Modi t-shirt attacking police personnel has gone viral. The image has been linked to the ongoing farmers’ protest.

Multiple Twitter and Facebook users have posted this image with Bangla, Hindi, and English captions.

According to some of the posts with a Bangla caption, the person in the image disguised himself as a farmer and attacked the police to defame the protest against the farm laws. The caption also stated that his identity lies in the Modi t-shirt he’s wearing.

India Today Anti-Fake News War room (AFWA) found that the viral image is seven-year-old and is from Uttar Pradesh. It has no connection with the ongoing farmers’ protest. On June 30, 2014, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers clashed with police in UP during protests against the Akhilesh Yadav government over rising crime rates in the state.

Truth behind the viral image

With the help of reverse image search, we found the image in question was published as part of multiple media reports in 2014. The Telegraph has given the photo courtesy to Press Trust of India (PTI).

The caption for the photo reads, “A BJP activist fights with a policeman during the protest outside the Assembly in Lucknow on Monday (PTI).”

According to these news reports, on June 30, 2014, BJP as an opposition party protested against the ruling Samajwadi Party government against the spiralling cases of crime in Uttar Pradesh. During this protest, BJP workers fought police batons and water cannons outside the state Assembly in Lucknow.

The same photo also went viral last year with the claim that this was a BJP worker fighting against the West Bengal police, which was debunked by the fact-checkers.

Here again the image went viral with a misleading claim that it is linked to the ongoing farmers’ agitation.
