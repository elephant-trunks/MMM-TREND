Spread the truth:

Did Brett Lee along with his wife convert to Hinduism ?

The posts on an UnOfficial Page under name of BJP, which has 739 Shares by now and which in few hours will cross thousands in number says –

“ब्रेट ली और लाना एंडरसन

हमने सनातन धर्म अपनाया है क्या आप हमारा हिन्दू धर्म मे स्वागत करेंगे ..??”

English – “Brett Lee and Lana Anderson – We have accepted Sanatan Religion, will you welcome us in Hinduism?”

This is False.

In India we respect our guests with Namastey and Garlands. But just a garland doesn’t change the guest’s religion.

So, He hasn’t change his religion yet.

He came to Mumbai to collaborate with St. Jude’s Childcare Center to promote Music Therapy
