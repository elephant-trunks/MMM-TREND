A video of a man smearing ink on a cleric in Ajmer has resurfaced with claims that a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader was assaulted for supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens.

The video shows a man smearing a cleric's face with ink suddenly. Taken aback, the latter stands up and makes advances towards the assaulter, who in turn hits him with a pair of shoe. Later, people intervene and stop the fight.

The video falsely identifies the assaulted as Inayat Hussain, national treasurer of the BJP Minority Morcha and former chairman of the Haj Committee. The video has been captioned as, "Inayaat Hussain was welcomed in Indore. Do watch the video. You must have seen such a welcome for the first time."

The clip is viral on Twitter, Facebook and Youtube with similar claims. Two such tweets are archived here and here.
