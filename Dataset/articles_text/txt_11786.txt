A photo, which claims to show Delhi's Jama Masjid after it was damaged because of the recent storm, is being shared on social media.

However, the photo dates back to 2017 when the dome of the Jama Masjid located at Uparkot in Uttar Pradesh's Bulandshahr collapsed due to weakening of the walls after the water from the drains had engulfed the walls.
