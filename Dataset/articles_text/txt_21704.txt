Vaccinations have picked pace in India as the country battles a surge in Covid-19 cases. Amid this, a short clip of a health worker injecting an "empty syringe" in a man's arm is being shared on social media with the claim that the video was shot in a hospital in India.

The claim goes on to imply that the hospital first administers a fake jab to the patient and then sells the actual Covid vaccine on the black market.

The caption of the video says, "Watch closely.... The injection is withdrawn without administering the vaccine!. So be alert, big racket in hospital in india, they are than selling it in black Mkt".

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading. The video was shot at a vaccination unit of the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico. The health worker was later removed from service. The archived versions of similar posts can be seen here and here.

Breaking the video into keyframes and then running a reverse image search on InVID tool, we found that the video was carried by several social media handles and news websites in Mexico.

The video was also carried by the official YouTube channel of Mexican newspaper EI Universal.

According to these reports, the video shows a nurse pretending to administer the Covid-19 vaccine to an elderly man at the National School of Biological Sciences in National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico.

The incident took place on April 3, 2021, and was brought to light by a relative of the man, who was later vaccinated in the presence of his family members. The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) later removed the nurse from service. It also issued an apology on April 4.

Hence, it is clear that the video in question is from Mexico and not related to India.
