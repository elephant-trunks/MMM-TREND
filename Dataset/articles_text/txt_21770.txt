The central Asian country of Tajikistan was hit by a strong earthquake of magnitude 6.3 late on February 12, 2021. Tremors were also felt in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan at the same time.

Among various pictures and videos on social media, a set of three images showing people standing amid the debris of a collapsed building is being circulated. It is being said that these are scenes from the recent earthquake in Afghanistan.

The caption to one such post reads, "#Shocking Live Pictures from Afghanistan".

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim along with the images is misleading. These pictures were taken after an earthquake shook eastern Turkey last year. Though, Afghanistan did experience an earthquake of magnitude 6.3 on February 12.

With the help of reverse image search, we found that the same pictures were carried by multiple news reports in January 2020 as from Turkey.

We found the same visual in a video (https://globalnews.ca/news/6458365/turkey-earthquake-sivrice/ ) showing rescuers pulling out injured people from the rubble of a collapsed building. The video was part of a "Global News" story on a massive earthquake that shook eastern Turkey on January 25, 2020.

According to the story, the earthquake took place in Elazig province of eastern Turkey, as well as neighbouring Malatya province. According to a BBC report, at least 31 people were killed and more than 1,600 injured in the earthquake.

We found the second image along with the viral post carried by The New Indian Express in a report published on January 25, 2020.

The caption of the image credited to Associated Press reads, "Rescue workers search on a collapsed building after a 6.8 earthquake struck Sivrice town in Elazig in eastern Turkey."

The third image that shows a small group of people staring at a collapsed building was carried by the Associated Press in an article published on January 25, 2020.

The description of the image reads, "People look at a collapsed building after a 6.8 earthquake struck Elazig city centre in the eastern Turkey, Friday, Jan. 24, 2020. An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.8 rocked eastern Turkey on Friday, causing some buildings to collapse and killing at least four people, Turkish officials said."

Meanwhile, an earthquake of magnitude 6.3 was reported on Friday night in Afghanistan's Fayzabad. According to the country's National Center for Seismology, the quake took place at 10.31 pm. However, there are no reports of major damage from Afghanistan.

Hence, it is clear that all the images in question showing a collapsed building are from an earthquake that rocked Turkey last year. The images are not related to the recent earthquake in Afghanistan and other parts of Asia.
