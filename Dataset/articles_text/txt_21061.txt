Communal violence occurred during a Hanuman Jayanti procession in northwest Delhi's Jahangirpuri area on April 16. According to the police, nine people, including eight police personnel and a resident, were injured. Police arrested fourteen people for rioting and attempting to murder, among other charges.

Following this, a photo has gone viral with claims it showed the violence in Jahangirpuri. It showed a policeman lying on the road, possibly injured, and a man appearing to aim a stone at him.

People shared the photo on Twitter alongside hashtags like #DelhiRiots and #Jahangirpuri.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the viral image was almost three years old and not from Delhi. It was from an anti-CAA protest in Ahmedabad.

Reverse-searching the photo led us to a December 20, 2019, Tweet by IPS officer Pankaj Nain. The photo in the old tweet proved it did not belong to the recent Jahangirpuri clash.

The reverse image search also led us to a report from the news portal Desh Gujarat from December 20, 2019. The report carrying the photo was about a protest that broke out in the Shah Alam area of Ahmedabad.

Further searches led us to a Times of India report that carried the same image on December 20, 2019. The caption said, "People attack a policeman in Shah-E-Alam area in Ahmedabad on Thursday."

The report noted that a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) turned violent in Ahmedabad. It resulted in at least 30 people getting injured, including 12 cops.

So, while cops were injured in the Jahangirpuri violence on April 16, we concluded that the photo shared on social media did not capture that.
