To verify the viral claim, we checked the official Twitter timeline of Shah Rukh Khan and did not find any such tweet. However, we found a promotional video of the film dated March 02, 2022. Shahrukh Khan announced the release date of the Pathan film as 25 January 2023. But he did not make any such appeal to his fans and the audience that if the movie flopped then he would have to sell his house.

It is noteworthy that if any such statement had been made on behalf of Shahrukh Khan, then any news channel or newspaper would have published this news. But, no news report or article was found regarding this.

Hence, the viral claim is fake.
