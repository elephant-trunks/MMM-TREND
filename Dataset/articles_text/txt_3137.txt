We extracted keyframes of the video and put them through a Reverse Image Search. The search led to the longer version of the video. The original video was uploaded by the YouTube channel TRIPURAINFOWAY TIWN on August 3, 2021. The title of the video read, “Education Minister Ratan Lal Nath’s residence was gheraoed by Students.”

The video description read: “Education Minister Ratan Lal Nath’s residence was gheraoed by Madhyamik candidates who could not pass in Board Exams. They have alleged scams and partiality with students. TIWN Video Aug 3, 2021″

On searching further, we found another video on the same channel, where he can be seen being taken away by the police. The video was shared with the title, “Tripura Board Exam Results: Forceful arrests of Students in Agartala.”
