Fact Check-

We started our investigation by running a keyword search on Google that led us to articles published by Time and Ajc’s website. According to the information on the website, Ellen Church was the first female flight attendant ever to fly and make history on 15 May 1930. She embarked on a Boeing Air Transport, which was a 20-hour flight from Oakland to Chicago.

Next, we ran a reverse image search on Google that led us to IMDB’s website, which, mentioned that this video shows pop star Britney Spears music video Toxic in 2004. The original image is not black and white in color but is a colored image.

Below you can see the comparison image between the viral image and the original image.

We also searched for the music video on YouTube, which led us to the entire 3 minute 30 second music video. The video is posted on Britney Spears Youtube channel on 25 October 2009 with the caption Britney Spear- Toxic.
