Fact check

After cross-checking we found that the protest in Malaysia regarding the massacre of Indian Muslims was held in 2020, in front of the Indian High Commission of India in Kuala, Lumpur. The reason behind the protest was claimed to be the oppression of Muslims after they protested against Citizenship Amendment Act 2019.

The above-given information was found in the press release by Hizbut Tahrir Malaysia. They also posted the picture of the protest side and which is also similar to the viral image.

Therefore, recently, no such protest in Malaysia took place for the persecution of Muslims.

Conclusion: The claim is misleading.
