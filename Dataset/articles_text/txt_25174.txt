Spread the truth:

An image showing West Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha at an informal gathering has been going viral stating that the image is from recent times, criticising him for giving out the wrong COVID-19 related data and for disrespecting the lockdown norms laid out by the centre.

The image is as follows:

On Facebook, the post was shared along with the caption: “শুনেছি মাতালরা নাকি সত্যবাদী হয়,কিন্তু আপনারা ছবিতে যেই মাতালটাকে দেখতে পাচ্ছেন এ পুর মিথ্যেবাদী. রাজ্যের মুখ্য সচিব রাজিব সিনহা করোনায় মিথ্যে তথ্য দিয়ে গোটা রাজ্যকে বিপদে ফেলে দিয়ে, মদের গ্লাসে চুমুক দিতে দিতে মজা নিচ্ছে.”

The translation of which is as follows: “I have heard that drunkards are truthful, but the drunkard you see in the picture is a complete liar. Chief Secretary Rajiv Sinha is making fun of the whole state by giving false information about Corona and sipping a glass of liquor.”

Truth

The image in circulation is clearly not a recent picture. A simple Google reverse image search leaded to Rajiva Sinha’s Facebook profile where he had posted the picture back in 2013 with the caption, “A quieter evening at Patna.” The post has since then been deleted. However, a screenshot of the same is as follows and the archived image can be found here. Hence it can established that contrary to the viral caption, the image is not from recent times.
