Delhi Police beats up Jamia students

In a third video, one which seems to be the continuation of the video released by Delhi Police, police officials are seen entering into the Jamia Millia Islamia Reading Room for PG students on December 15, where students can be seen barricading themselves. What follows is horrific visuals of police beating students, as many of them approach with palms folded. The video shows students piling up against each other, to escape being hit. In the background, a student is seen receiving blows to his head. The video ends with a police official attempting to break the CCTV camera which is recording this video.

The Delhi Police denies having entered Jamia Millia Islamia on December 15.
