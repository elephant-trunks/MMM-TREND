Spread the truth:

A photo is currently viral on social media, WhatsApp etc claiming RSS is distributing slippers in a gujarat.

A post by Tony Francis says

“These Sandals are supplied for free in Gujarat, by some people hoping it would start a 2002 style riot, which will improve BJP’s chances of winning the forthcoming elections , …👇

But Christians are not bothered, because they are not crazy illiterates like the Chaddies (who would have lynched a dozen people by now, if the picture was of a Hindu God).”

The truth is, this photo was viral globally last year already I.e. since July 2016. The original is not known yet but there was a furore, discussions worldwide on this matter.
