He bowed down to his birth place, not to anyone else.

The photo was captioned, “In a rare emotional gesture, after landing at the helipad near his village, Paraunkh of Kanpur Dehat district of Uttar Pradesh, President Ram Nath Kovind bowed and touched the soil to pay obeisance to the land of his birth.”

Further, while addressing a Jan Abhinandan Samaroh in Kanpur Dehat on June 27, Kovind said, “I have always wanted to visit my birth place, it’s been years now I have waited. So, when I got down from the helicopter, I touched the soil of my birth land and prayed that though it has been late this time, this won’t happen in the future and that I can come back soon.”
