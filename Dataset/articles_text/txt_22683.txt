A few other Facebook users have posted the same claim.

The Truth

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that this claim is not true. Ahmed Javed in an interview with a newspaper had cleared that he took his full salary.

AFWA searched the internet and found that a newspaper had filed a source-based story about this in 2015 when Javed took over the office of the Mumbai police commissioner. The news report claimed that Javed took only Rs 1 token salary and donated the rest to the police fund. This was subsequently picked up by other web portals as well.

However, in 2016 when Javed retired as Mumbai Police Commissioner and was going to take his new assignment as India's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, he was asked this question by some journalists. He had replied that it was only a rumor.

Javed was quoted by The Indian Express saying, "So many times I have been asked about this at several stages in my career. All I will say is that I take whatever is due to me from the government as salary."
