Up Govt. To Start Production Of Orange Hijabs, Says It Solves Issue Of Both Sideshttps://t.co/es8El7JEoB — The Fauxy (@the_fauxy) February 14, 2022

Fact check

After cross-checking the authenticity behind the statement made by Yogi Adityanath, we got an article of Hindustan, which has covered the original statement made by CM. UP Chief Minister in an interview with ANI said that system should work with discipline and not with personal beliefs, likes and dislikes. He also raised a question, “may I speak to all the employees or people in the north to wear saffron?

#WATCH भारत की व्यवस्था संविधान के अनुरूप चलनी चाहिए, हमारी व्यक्तिगत आस्था और पसंद-नापसंद हम देश और संस्थाओं पर लागू नहीं कर सकते हैं। क्या मैं UP में सभी कर्मचारियों या लोगों को बोल सकता हूं कि आप भी भगवा धारण करें? स्कूल में ड्रेस कोड लागू होना चाहिए: हिजाब मामले पर UP CM pic.twitter.com/KwuwQ1UKd2 — ANI_HindiNews (@AHindinews) February 14, 2022

Therefore, the claim is misleading as CM Yogi made no such statement regarding Saffron Hijab.

Claim review: Did Yogi Adityanath say that Saffron Hijab is the solution for the conflict?
