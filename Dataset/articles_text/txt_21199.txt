Indian travel vlogger Anant Mittal, who runs the YouTube channel 'On Road Indian', has claimed he was detained for 15 hours by Chinese authorities. The detention was reportedly triggered by a social media post where he asserted that 'Arunachal is a part of India' while on Chinese soil. Mittal described the ordeal as intimidating, alleging he was denied food while other detainees were fed. He stated, 'I had taken a small stand of Arunachal Pradesh... I had written it on the soil of China.' The vlogger expressed regret over the timing of his statement, noting he felt powerless during the interrogation.
