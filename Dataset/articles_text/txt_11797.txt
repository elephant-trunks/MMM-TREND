Claim

A video of some Muslim men thrashing few youngsters on a truck and chasing them away is circulating with a false claim that it shows Hindus were attacked by Muslims in India. The Hindi caption with the video roughly translates to, "There were 50 Hindus in the car. Only 5 Muslims came. Look at the result.. Guess what happened? Since we have got rid of our weapons by teaching us the lessons of non-violence, then all these are weighing on us. There is still time to improve, become Ram and Parashuram Hanuman. Fight for your rights, fight for yourself. Don't run. Jai Hind." (Original Text in Hindi: गाड़ी में 50 हिंदू थे, Only 5 मुल्ले आए देख लो नतीजा.. सोचो ऐसा क्या हुआ ? जबसे हमको अहिंसा का पाठ पढ़ा कर हथियार छुड़ाए है तब ये सब हम पर भारी पड़ रहे है अभी भी वक्त है सुधर जाओ राम और परशुराम हनुमान बनो अपने अधिकार के लिए लड़ो अपने लिए लड़ो भागो मत जय हिंद)
