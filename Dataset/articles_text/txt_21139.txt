On Thursday, March 10, Yogi Adityanath scored a major win for the Bharatiya Janata Party in Uttar Pradesh. Amid this, a collage of three photos went viral on social media.

Several Facebook users shared the collage, where three different persons could be seen hanging. The claim in Hindi alongside these photos translated to: “Three brothers died by suicide in Prayagraj after watching Akhilesh Yadav getting defeated in the UP polls.”

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the images had nothing to do with the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. No such incidents of three brothers dying by suicide took place in Prayagraj, following the poll results.

AFWA PROBE

While investigating the claim, we first conducted a keyword search to find out whether any search incident took place in Prayagraj while the counting process was on. We found no media reports.

We then reverse-searched the images and found the source of the first image. Two different news outlets — Sanjeevni Today and Sudama News carried the first photo in reports published in November 2020.

According to the reports, the photo is from Ramgarh, where a Bokaro resident Randhir Kumar, 25, died by suicide. We also got in touch with Ajay Kumar, the SSP of Prayagraj. “No such incidents have been reported in Prayagraj,” Kumar told India Today.

Although we could not verify the source of the other two photographs used in this claim, we can still confidently conclude that these photos are in no way of three brothers dying by suicide following the results of the UP assembly election.
