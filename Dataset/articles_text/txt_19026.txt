The BJP secured a thumping majority capturing 56 seats out of the 70 seats, restricting the Congress to just 11 seats in Uttarakhand assembly election 2017.



The viral graphics can be seen below. While one of the fake graphics predicts 52-55 seats for the Congress in Uttarakhand the other fake graphic claims the party could win 46-51 seats in the state.
