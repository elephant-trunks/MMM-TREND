Truth

The claim attached to the photo is false. The image is not of Jayalalitha and Nirmala Sitharaman. The photo is of Jayalalitha with the famous Tamil writer, Shivashankari. Upon doing a reverse image search the image was found on a site called ‘Vintage Indian Clothing” that had published the image and mentioned that it is a photo of Jayalalitha and Shivashankari. The same photo was also found in an article by a tamil website called Vikatan where they had published an article on Jayalalitha’s friends and Shivashankari is mentioned in the same. The photo was also compared with Nirmala Sitharaman’s picure when she was young and no similarities were found.

Thus it is proved that the photo is not of Jayalalitha and Nirmala Sitharaman, instead of Jayalalitha and Shivashankari.

Attached below are the screenshots and links of the articles by Vintage Indian Clothing and Vikatan.

This is the photo of Nirmala Sitharaman when she was young, as you can see there aren’t many similarities with the photo that was shared.
