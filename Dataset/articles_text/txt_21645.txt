A video circulating on social media shows an aged man touching a woman’s back, with netizens claiming he is the President of Azerbaijan who apparently forgot to switch off his camera after a video chat.

The video shows the man facing the camera when a woman enters the room. As she bends to get something, the man turns and touches her back. Several Facebook users have posted the video with the caption, “Azerbaijan President forgot to Exit Zoom meeting”.

Some Facebook users also claim the man is the Prime minister of Azerbaijan.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the man is neither the President nor the Prime Minister of Azerbaijan. He is a former MP of the country and university professor Huseynbala Miralamov, who was fired from both the university and the ruling New Azerbaijan Party (YAP) after the video leaked on social media last month.

Using keyword search, we found media reports from Azerbaijan related to the viral video. As per these reports, the man is Huseynbala Miralamov, a former MP of the country and university teacher.

Miralamov was the head of ‘Oil and Gas Transportation and Storage’ department at the Faculty of Gas and Petroleum Engineering, Azerbaijan State Oil and Industry University. After the video went viral last month, he was dismissed from his post and also expelled from the ruling New Azerbaijan Party (YAP).

In an interview to a local website, Miralamov said the incident happened during a university conference, and alleged that certain people leaked the video to blackmail him.

The President of Azerbaijan is Ilham Aliyev and the Prime Minister is Ali Asadov. There is no recent media report of either of them being embroiled in a video leak controversy involving a woman.

Hence, the Facebook posts claiming that the man touching a woman in the viral video is the President of Azerbaijan are misleading. The man is a former MP of the country.
