Cricketer Virat Kohli and his actor wife Anushka Sharma have consciously kept their daughter Vamika's identity under the wraps. As revealed by Virat during an ‘Ask me anything session’ , the couple has decided not to expose Vamika to social media before she herself has an understanding of what the platform is.

But, if some netizens are to be believed, the first-ever glimpse of Vamika’s face has now been revealed. Two images - allegedly showing Virat Kohli with Vamika - are doing rounds on social media. In both these images, the face of the baby girl is clearly visible. A Twitter user shared with the caption, “Finally, #ViratKohli 's daughter vamika Kohli face revealed”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral image shows Virat Kohli’s lookalike Susobhan Lahiri, a resident of Ranaghat in Bengal. The baby girl seen with him in the pictures is his niece Ivanshi Bhattacharya. Susobhan himself confirmed this to India Today.
