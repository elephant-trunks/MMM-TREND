Truth

The viral video is actually 3 years old.

The claim is false. The video is not a recent one where the Canadian Prime Minister is packing Covid-19 ration for the public. The video has “Islamic Relief Canada” written on top. When following the lead with a relevant search the video was found to be uploaded on 22nd June 2017 by Islamic Relief Canada on You Tube. They also posted the video on their official Facebook Page on 11th May 2017. The picture of the same was also posted by Justin Trudeau himself on his official Facebook page on 16th June 2017. The event occurred 3 years ago and was a part of community activities for Ramadan. The event had also been featured in various publications like Khaleej Times and Centre for Investigative Research Canada. It is an old video that is shared with a false message and given a political angle to deceive the public.
