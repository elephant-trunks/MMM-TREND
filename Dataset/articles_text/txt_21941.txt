Democrat candidate Joe Biden won the United States elections in a closely contested fight with his Republican rival and incumbent President Donald Trump. On social media, the purported cover page of 'Time' magazine is going viral that shows Trump's silhouette from behind, exiting a doorway. The cover title says, "Time to go".



The viral image is mostly circulating on WhatsApp. Several Twitter users have posted the image, with the caption saying, "Loving the Time magazine front cover: #TrumpOut".

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral image is not a genuine Time magazine cover, but a fabricated mock job. The image does not appear in Time's online vault that displays all published covers.

The archived versions of the viral posts can be seen here, here, here, here and here.

The viral picture does not match with Time's layout. When we closely look at any original Time magazine cover, we find that it has a standard style of mentioning the date of issue on the top right-hand side; also, "time.com" is mentioned at the bottom right-hand corner. But these elements are missing from the viral image.

We also found that the viral image does not appear in "The Vault" section of Time that displays all published covers of the magazine.

The viral image was being circulated a few months back too. In May this year, a Time spokesperson had confirmed to Reuters via mail that the image was not an authentic magazine cover.
