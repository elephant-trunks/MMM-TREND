A disturbing image showing several bodies lying on the street is going viral on social media with the claim that the Indian Army has massacred Muslims in Kashmir.

Facebook page “Life News” shared the picture along with the caption, “How the Indian Army is killing our Muslims. Our Muslim brothers and sisters are being tortured in Kashmir.”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the picture to be misleading. The picture is from Venezuela where close to 50 inmates were shot dead by security forces after a riot broke out inside a prison last month.

AFWA investigation

Using Yandex reverse search, we found that the viral picture was used in an article by Venezuelan news website “Que Pasa” on May 7, 2020. The report said more than 40 people were killed after clashes broke out between prisoners and police at a jail in Guanare city of Venezuela. Some security officials were also injured in the clashes.

The death toll later went up to 47, while more than 60 people were injured, mostly with gunshot wounds. News website “PanAm Post” also used a similar picture of the incident with the same information. The incident took place on May 1.

Citing local media, another news website “En Son Haber” said the prisoners were killed when they attempted to escape during the clashes.

Several international media organisations had also covered the incident. As per “The Guardian”, the clashes at the prison started with an inmate demanding that relatives be allowed to deliver him food.

Hence, it can be concluded that the viral post is misleading and the picture is not from India but Venezuela.
