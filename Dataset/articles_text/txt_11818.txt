An imaged, purportedly being from the Reserve Bank of India [RBI], promising ₹4.59 crores or half a million (500,000) British pounds is fake and is a scam.

While the government has denied the veracity of the image, it also shows telltale signs that of the image having problems with its authenticity.

The image conveys a letter, from a non-existent Foreign Exchange Transfer Department within the RBI, promising half a million British pounds equivalent to ₹4.59 crores on behalf of the British government to the intended beneficiary upon receipt of details like identity, photos and demographic details like age, sex and details like bank account details.

The image can be found below.













BOOM found no evidence that such an arrangement has taken place between the RBI and the British government.

Another red flag that this is fake is the email address (rbi_transfer.india@rbigovt.co.in), which does not exist. RBI officials use the @rbi.org.in for official purposes.

The factchecking department of the Press Information Bureau has also rubbished this claim.
