After the remarkable win of AAP in the Punjab Election 2022 and Bhagwant Mann taking the position of chief minister Punjab, Social media is filled with different claims about him.

Punjab Lok Congress claimed that CM Bhagwant Mann has removed the photo of Maharaja Ranjit Singh from the office of Chief Minister Punjab.

Removing Sher-e-Punjab Maharaja Ranjit Singh's picture from Chief Minister's office is unacceptable. Maharaja Ranjit Singh is a great symbol of Punjabis' pride, valour and courage. Nobody can take his place.

Many other users have also claimed that Punjab CM has replaced the picture with Bhagat Singh and Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar.

Fact check

After examining the claim and doing a google reverse image search, we found a tweet of ANI posting the image of Bhagwant Singh’s cabinet meet. We can see the picture of Ranjit Singh in the office behind the seat of Bhagwant Mann.

Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann addressed his maiden meeting after assuming charge as the Chief Minister of the state.



He urged the top brass of state civil & police administration to discharge their duties as public servants in the letter and spirit: CMO pic.twitter.com/2MrNQeNWJY — ANI (@ANI) March 17, 2022

Another claim, where the opposition is claiming that the picture has always been hung behind the seat of the CM or in the Centre of the hall is incorrect. In the report of ANI in 2021 when former Chief Minister, Charanjit Singh Channi held a cabinet meeting in Punjab, the picture of Maharaja Ranjit was not placed at the back. Therefore the claim is misleading.

Conclusion: the claim is misleading.
