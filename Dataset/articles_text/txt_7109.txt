A social media post accompanying a video of a man saving two children from drowning in floods is being widely circulated with a claim that video shows a father saving his two children. Through this article let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.

Claim: Visuals showing father saving his two sons from drowning in floods. Fact: The visuals are reported by Omani news articles recently. However, as per these articles it is not the father of the children who saved them from drowning but a photographer, who is present at the scene. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.

The viral visuals showing a man saving couple of children from drowning in floods is from Bahla, a town in Oman. However, the man saving the life of the children is not their father.

Reverse image search of the screenshots of the viral video yielded multiple news reports which reported the same visuals. As per one such news report, it is not the father but a photographer named Ali bin Nasser Al-Wardi who was present at the scene to take pictures, saved the life of two children drowning in the floods.

Even according to another news article, it is evident that the children were not saved by their father but by a stranger present at the location. Further, the article reported that he was appreciated by the police and government officials for his bravery.

To sum it up, the man in this video who saved two children from drowning in floods is not their father.
