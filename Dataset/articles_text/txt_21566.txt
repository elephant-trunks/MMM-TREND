In a report from Kolkata, a journalist highlights a significant protest staged by a pro-Bangla advocacy group outside the Bangladesh Embassy. The demonstrators expressed intense anger over the 'brutal murder' of a Hindu man and the rising atrocities against minorities, particularly Hindus, in the neighbouring nation. Reporting from the ground, the speaker noted that the group has demanded an immediate halt to all trade and benefits that India provides to Bangladesh in response to the 'heinous incident'. The broadcast also highlighted that similar agitations were witnessed in border areas near Kolkata, where people raised slogans against the Bangladesh government. The report underscores the growing concern over how Hindus are 'surviving there on a day-to-day basis' given the unsafe situation. The protesters are hitting the streets to voice their strong opposition and demand action.
