FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the post, and found it to be false.

We put the picture through a Reverse Image Search and found the same image in a report by Lokmat, dated May 15, 2022. As per the caption of the image, the picture is of Balasaheb Thackeray and Anand Dighe.

The Marathi caption (in English translation) says: “Balasaheb’s only question to Anand Dighe unlisted final; Uddhav Thackeray recalls.”

We found the same image in an article by BBC , dated April 2022. The report also mentioned that the image was of Balasaheb Thackeray and Anand Dighe.

Thus, from the above information, it is clear that the picture in question is not of Balasaheb Thackeray giving blessings to Eknath Shinde.
