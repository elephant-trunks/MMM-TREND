A screenshot of an image along with the caption written below is getting viral on social media. There were two men shown in the image.

The person on the right is the world economic forum (WEF) founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab, who is also a Professor and was born in Ravensburg, Germany in 1938.

Sharing this picture people are claiming that the man in military uniform is his father Eugen Schwab, who was a high-ranking Nazi close to Adolf Hitler.

A Twitter user writes, ‘On the left, you can see the founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab. On the right, his father, an intimate confidant of Hitler, the industrialist and fascist “Eugen Schwab” in uniform. Klaus was born in Hitler’s Germany in 1938. At that time, his father was in charge.’

The post is getting increasingly viral with different captions.

Fact Check:

To investigate the viral picture DFRAC found, the photo shared online is not of Eugen Schwab, but of Nazi general Walter Dybilasz. Who is said to have been born in 1892 and died in 1950, possibly in Soviet captivity, some also claim that he was awarded with awards like German cross.

Klaus Schwab’s father, on the other hand, was the managing director of a subsidiary of Zurich-based engineering firm Escher Wyss.

Conclusion:

The photo shared on social media is of German general Walter Dybilasz and not of WEF chief Klaus Schwab’s father. While Eugen Schwab was a member of some National Socialist organizations and managed a factory that used prisoners of war, this too does not tell any direct ties to the Nazi regime.

Claim Review: The viral picture is of an industrialist and fascist Eugen Schwab, who was close to Hitler.
