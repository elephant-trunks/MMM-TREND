Did "Shraddha Kapoor" slam the Congress over the alleged Machil fake encounter case of 2010?

A "tweet" posted by Facebook page -- I Support Narendra Bhai Modi Bjp -- has gone viral, claiming that the actor criticised the Congress over the incident.

India Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found this to be a bogus post as the Twitter handle mentioned in the Facebook post does not exist.

The Facebook post is opinionated and raises questions over the decision made by the Congress into the alleged encounter by the Army in 2010. Facebook users almost believed that Twitter handle @Shradha_Kap belongs to Bollywood actor Shraddha Kapoor and commented on the post. The fake Twitter account also carried a real picture of the actor.

This Facebook post has been shared more than 2,500 times at the time of filing the report. Facebook page I Support Narendra Bhai Modi Bjp has nearly 15,00,000 followers.

We found until June, 2018, people used to tag Twitter handle @Shradha_Kap in their posts.

However, the handle has now been suspended by Twitter India.

The original Twitter handle of actor Shraddha Kapoor is @ShraddhaKapoor and it has a blue tick on it, confirming the authenticity of the account.

Going through her posts, we found that the actor hardly tweets anything related to politics on her account.

We found from various newspaper reports that the incident the viral post referred to is the Machil encounter of Jammu and Kashmir which happened in 2010. Six Indian Army personnel, which included a Colonel, were court-martialed in 2013. The killings sparked unrest in the Valley leading to many deaths. Later in 2017, the Armed Forces Tribunal suspended the sentences and had given bail to all of them.

India Today had also reported about the case.
