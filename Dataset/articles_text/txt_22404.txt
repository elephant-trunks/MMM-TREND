On March 23, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced a statewide lockdown to control the spread of coronavirus. Essential services such as grocery and medical shops have been exempted from the lockdown.

However, soon after the announcement, a social media post has been going viral claiming that there are different timings for different shops providing essential services. This has been attributed to the Mumbai police commissioner.

Facebook user "Sheela Sharma" uploaded a post that said, "#Dates & #Timings for #Distributions of : (1) #MILK From #Morning 6 A.M to 8 A.M.#Daily) (2) #NEWS #PAPERS - Upto 7 A.M #Daily (3) #VEGETABLES, #KIRANA& #MEDICAL #SHOPS : From #Morning 8 A.M to 11 A.M. #on 24/26/28 & 30 #March only. By Order of #Mumbai #Police #Commissioner".

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that no such order has been issued by the Mumbai police commissioner. The Maharashtra government has ordered that grocery and medical shops be kept open, but has not specified any timing for them.

The claim has gone viral on Facebook, WhatsApp and other social media. The archived version of the post can be seen here.

Grocery and medical stores open

Maharashtra, which has reported more than 100 coronavirus cases so far, has ordered most shops and offices to close down to control the spread of Covid-19. Shops and manufacturing units dealing in essential goods have been exempted. This can be read in the detailed order tweeted by Mumbai Police.

Even CM Thackeray tweeted about the same. But at no point in the order or in Thackeray’s tweet are any timings mentioned for these shops.

No newspapers

Unlike what is being said in the claim, at present, no newspapers are being distributed in Mumbai. Vendor associations have decided not to distribute newspapers till the threat of coronavirus abates.

Mumbai Police clarify

Regarding the viral message, Mumbai Police Commissioner Parambir Singh too has clarified in a tweet saying, Namaste, I’m the Commissioner of @MumbaiPolice & this list has definitely not been made on my directions! The last thing we want to get infected with & pass on during such crisis is rumours. Pls verify every msg regarding emergency services before you forward #StaySafeFromRumours.

Thus, it is clear that the viral post regarding timings of essential services is fake as Mumbai Police have not issued any such order.
