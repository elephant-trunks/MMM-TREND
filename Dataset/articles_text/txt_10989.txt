FACT CHECK

A close inspection of the video raises doubt about the video’s authenticity. Though viral video seems to be live telecasted by some news channels, the logo of the channel is missing.

Considering these inconsistencies, we did a reverse image search on the keyframes of the video. Google results showed us that the viral clip is taken from gameplay.

It is from a video game called ArmA 3. You can see the ‘A-10 Warthog vs. Anti-Air Tank’ game simulation on YouTube.

You can visit the ArmA 3 game website here.

“Experience true combat gameplay in a massive military sandbox. Arma 3 is developed and published by Bohemia Interactive,” mentions It’s About US Page.

RUSSIA vs UKRAINE

According to BBC, Russia already deployed more than 100,000 troops close to the Ukraine border around 30,000 soldiers are engaged in military exercises in Belarus.

On other hand, Russia claimed that this is just a mere military exercise and it had already sent a few troops back to base.

This report also gave a graphical representation of the Russian army at the Ukraine border. As of 18 February, there was no engagement of troops on the battlefield. So the claim that viral video is a scene of war between Russia and Ukraine is false.

CONCLUSION

Clip of a video game – ArmA 3 – shared as real visuals of the Russia-Ukraine war. As per the news report, the war between the two nations has not started yet..
