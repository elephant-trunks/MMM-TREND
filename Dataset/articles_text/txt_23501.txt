Mumbai: "[I]n the last six years, not a single incident of blast has taken place," Union minister Prakash Javadekar said on March 7, 2020. The claim is false. More than 1,000 explosion incidents were reported in many parts of the country over the last six years, a FactChecker.in analysis of data recorded by the South Asia Terrorism Portal revealed.

"What we had experienced for 10-25 years (before (the) Modi government came to power)? We saw bomb blasts taking place in Pune, Vadodara, Ahmednagar, Delhi and Mumbai. Every eight to ten days, blasts used to happen and people used to get killed," Javadekar was quoted as saying in a Press Trust of India report published in The Hindu. "But in the last six years, not a single incident of blast has taken place. This has not happened just like that but due to some strong measures undertaken by the PM to ensure the safety and security in the country."

As many as 1,071 explosion incidents have been reported between January 2014, and March 8, 2020, in India, according to data from South Asia Terrorism Portal, a website that records and maintains database on terrorism and low intensity warfare in South Asia.

Four explosions were reported in Assam on January 26, 2020, with no casualties. The explosions were carried out using grenades and time-induced improvised explosive devices. The state's chief minister condemned the blast, promising "sternest action" to book the culprits.





Strongly condemn the bomb blasts in a few places of Assam. This cowardly attempt to create terror on a sacred day only exhibits the frustration of the terror groups after their total rejection by the people.



Our Govt will take the sternest action to bring the culprits to book. — Sarbananda Sonowal (@sarbanandsonwal) January 26, 2020
