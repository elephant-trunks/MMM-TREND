As the curtains fell on the Congress party's three-day Chintan Shivir in Udaipur, Rajasthan, on Sunday, May 15, many on social media criticised the party over the choice of colours at the venue of the event.

People alleged that the roof of the tent that hosted the meet was green and white — resembling the national flag of Pakistan, while the carpet on the floor was saffron. "Both colours of the Pakistan flag above and saffron on the floor! This is a picture of the Congress Party's Chintan Shivir in Udaipur, Rajasthan," one such tweet read.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the claim was misleading. The roof of the tent incorporated all three shades of the Indian national flag.
