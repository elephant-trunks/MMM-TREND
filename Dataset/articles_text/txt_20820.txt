On October 24,2021, as the violence in Bangladesh began to settle a bit, an image of thousands of people gathered in a field started to go viral on Facebook.

As per users, this image was taken in Assam where Hindus from all over the area gathered to protest the conditions of Bangladeshi Hindus.

Fact-Check:

We performed a reverse image search on the picture and found that various users on Twitter had posted this image in 2019. As per users, this crowd had gathered in Mangalore’s Nehru maidan to listen to PM Modi’s speech.

Here is the original image posted in 2019.

@narendramodi ji Many have come from different continents to vote (including me) only for you. Our region need your special focus for “Multifold Vikas”. We have high potential for growth in tourism and industry. — itsme1802 (@itsme1802) April 14, 2019

Since the image is old and the intention was different this claim is misleading.
