At a time people are desperately looking for treatment against Covid-19, an injection named “Covipri” is circulating on social media, with many referring to it as the Remdesivir injection.

Remdesivir is not a magic drug against Covid, but doctors are using it on a case-to-case basis to reduce severity of the infection. Hence, this medicine is on high demand and there is shortage of supply.

In the meantime, an image of “Covipri” packets, with “Remdesivir” injection written on them, is being shared on Facebook. Many users are claiming that the drug is available and people who need these for Covid patients can contact them.
