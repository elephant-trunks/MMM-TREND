Ukraine on Thursday claimed to have shot down five Russian warplanes and a helicopter in reaction to the invasion. Soon, a photo of an airborne aircraft on fire went viral on social media with claims it was one of the ill-fated Russian birds.

"Aircraft from 6th Russia Air Force, downed by Ukraine," read one such tweet sharing the image.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found this claim to be misleading. This photo in question has been in circulation on the internet for many years and is unrelated to the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

Similar claims have been archived here and here.

A reverse search of the image proved that this photo was an old one. On May 21, 2017, the flipped version of the image was used by French website Pars Daily along with a news report of a Saudi F-15 fighter jet shot down in Yemen.

The image was also spotted on a blog that was last updated on August 6, 2008.

This proved that the photo was unrelated to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Air Team Images, an aviation image library website contained a flipped but higher-resolution version of the image with more details. The photo was from July 24, 1993, at England's Fairford. Taken by photographer Carl Ford, it captured the mid-air collision between two Russian Mig 29s during an air show. The caption also mentioned that there was no loss of life in the accident as the pilots managed to eject on time.

Hence, we conclude that the image shared as that of a Russian aircraft shot by Ukraine is old. It was photographed in 1993 when two Russian MiGs collided during an air show in the United Kingdom.
