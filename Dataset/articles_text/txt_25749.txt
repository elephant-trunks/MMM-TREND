FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked this video, and found the claim to be false.

We extracted the keyframes of the video and on putting them through the Reverse Image Search, we came across a Facebook post, dated March 11, 2019, which featured the same video. The caption with the video reads: “Kumbh Mela Naga Sadhu”

We found the same video posted on a YouTube page ‘Apna Awadh’ published on April 19, 2019.

According to the caption, the video shows the congregation of sadhus during the Kumbha Mela in 2019, at Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh.

Though NewsMobile could not independently verify the origin of the video, it is clear that the video is pretty old.

NewsMobile debunked the same video in 2020 when it was shared with a false claim. The article can be read here and here
