A video of Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi AdityaNath is getting viral on social media. Moreover, the video claims that CM Yogi accepted that he does pro- Rajput politics. Politician Sanjay Singh posted this video on his Twitter handle along with the caption which nearly translates in English, “See, Adityanath Ji has made it clear that if anyone tells them that “he is only leaders of Kshatriyas, then he won’t feel bad”. You should be the leader of 24 crore people, Adityanath Ji. Is the slogan of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas a mere sham?”

ये देखिये आदित्यनाथ जी ने साफ़ कर दिया की कोई भी इनको कहे की “ये सिर्फ़ क्षत्रियों के नेता हैं तो इनको बुरा नही लगता”

आपको तो 24 करोड़ लोगों का नेता होना चाहिये आदित्यनाथ जी।

क्या सबका साथ सबका विकास का नारा दिखावा मात्र है? pic.twitter.com/pqky6jR8pi — Sanjay Singh AAP (@SanjayAzadSln) January 29, 2022

Consequently, many other social media users shared this post on their handles.

FactCheck

On our FactCheck analysis, we found that this video is a clip of Yogi Adityanath’s interview with Hindustan Times’ Sr Resident Editor Sunita Aron. After the whole interview, we come to know that the viral video is presented misleadingly.

Further, we found the above video of the same interview on the Hindustan Times Youtube channel with the caption, “How CM Yogi rebutted 80:20 remark row, divisive politics, and pro-Rajput charge.” In the interview, CM Yogi refused to say that, he and his Government have worked for the benefit of people without any discrimination.
