In Commonwealth Games, 2022 Medal Tally India ranks sixth with 3 golds and 6 overall. On Sunday Weightlifter Achinta Sheuli won the third gold in the Commonwealth Games.

Meanwhile, users on social media are busy congratulating sprinter Hima Das claiming that she has won the gold medal in the 400m race along with a video of Hima Das where she is seen winning the race.

A Twitter user writes, “Hima Das wins 400m Gold in CWG at Birmingham.”

Similar claims are made on Facebook by many people on Facebook.

Fact Check:

In the video the commentator is heard saying, “history made in Tampere.” Around the two-minute mark, he goes, “…the Indian flag would fly proudly and historically here in Finland.”

This sentence is enough to know that the video is not from the recent commonwealth games

We also found the same video on many YouTube channels under the caption, “Hima Das’ 400m Gold Medal Interview | IAAF World U20 Championships Tampere 2018.”
