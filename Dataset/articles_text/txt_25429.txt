Spread the truth:

Fresh Mass slaughter in Kerala as a protest against Beef Ban ?

While yesterday’s news of congress guys slaughtering a calf is true, many are using false, old photos to trigger anger.

False: This photo is getting Viral claiming to be latest from Kerala where people slaughtered many Cows on streets as their protest against Beef Ban.

Truth: The photo is atleast 7 years old, it was posted in a blog claiming to be from a pakistan, but given the shop names and details it could be from Bangladesh as well. No such news was found regarding West Bengal but quite possible.

The name of the shop is “Shahnoor Agencies – pipes and fittings”. A plumbing shop probably.
