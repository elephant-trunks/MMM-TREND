A disturbing footage of some youngsters falling off a jam-packed floor of a building after the metal railing gave away is being widely shared on social media. It is being said that the tragic accident took place in Guwahati.

A Facebook user shared the video with the caption, “7 students died after falling from 4th floor in Guwahati! Please be careful in a crowded place. May Allah rest their soul in peace.”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is from the Public University of El Alto in Bolivia.

Many people are sharing the video on Facebook, believing that this incident actually took place in Guwahati.

A simple reverse search of the video keyframes shows that the tragedy took place on March 2, 2021, at the Public University of El Alto in Bolivia. The same video can be seen in this report by “The Times of India.”

The incident took place at the university’s financial sciences building when students were trying to enter a lecture hall for an assembly, as per a report by “The New York Post.”

Another report by “The Sun” says that at least seven students died as they dropped four floors below. Many others were injured.

Had any such incident took place in Guwahati, it would have definitely been covered by every media outlet. But we did not find any report about such an incident in Guwahati.

Thus, it is clear that the tragic incident of students falling off the fourth floor happened in Bolivia and not Guwahati.
