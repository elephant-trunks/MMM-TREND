A religious congregation by Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi's Nizamuddin has turned out to be the super-spreader of novel coronavirus with multiple deaths and infections across India traced to the event.

More than 2,000 people from different states and countries had attended the congregation held from March 13-15.

And now, a video showing people sitting on their knees and praying is doing rounds on social media platforms.

It is being claimed that these people are sneezing purposefully to spread novel coronavirus at Hazrat Nizamuddin mosque in Delhi.

India Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading. The video has been in circulation for many months.

We found the video posted by Facebook user 'Ridouan Soumaa' on January 29, 2020, a couple of months before the Tablighi Jamaat conference at Nizamuddin.

YouTube account 'sahibg official' uploaded the same video on January 31, 2020, with the caption, "Corona virus big attack in Pakistan/fani".

People in the video are performing Zikr or Zikir, a method of praying mostly followed in Sufism. Usually during Zikir, people repeat the prayers.

However, we could not trace the origin of the video.

But it is certain that the video has nothing to do with the faithful purposefully sneezing to spread novel coronavirus at Hazrat Nizamuddin mosque in Delhi.
