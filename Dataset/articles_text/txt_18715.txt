FACT-CHECK

BOOM found that the viral image is edited and in the original newspaper ad in Dainik Jagran, we can see that Mahatma Gandhi's photo is larger than Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's cutout.

In the Twitter replies, we found several people replying to the tweet carrying the fake image with the original ad in the paper.

We then cross checked the ad, by looking up the original in Hindi newspaper Dainik Jagran's epaper edition for Delhi on October 2, 2021. In the e-paper it is clear that Kejriwal's photo was not larger than Gandhi's as being claimed.
