Fact Check

In our fact check analysis we found that the incumbent governor of bank of England is Andrew John Bailey since 16 March 2020.

Further, on reverse search of the image used by the users we found a report of Indian Express of 4th September 2013. The title of the report is, “Raghuram Rajan takes over as 23rd Governor of Reserve Bank.”

Hence, the image used by the user is old. It is of the time when Rajan was appointed as governor of RBI. Moreover, on keyword research we have not found any such report that he is going to be appointed as the governor if bank of India yet.

This fake news was spread in 2018 also when politician like Sashi Tharoor also tweeted this.

Conclusion

Rajan is not going to be appointed as the governor of bank of England.
