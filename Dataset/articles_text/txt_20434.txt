A video of a man giving a speech is getting viral on social media platforms. In the speech, he is provoking people to boycott Reliance Jio and switch to other brands.

The video is getting viral with the claim that the man giving the speech is the owner of the Himalaya Company.

The owner of the Himalaya Company is a Muslim & listen to his speech! He asks to boycott Reliance Jio & switch over to other brands, saying those funds go to RSS which uses it to buy arms to fight Muslims. If we boycott Himalaya for Halal Compliance??? #BoycottHimalaya

The caption reads.

Fact Check:

To know the authenticity of this video we reverse search the Image and used certain key words.

We found the same video on YouTube channel of Times Express from the year 2020. The man giving the speech is a well-known lawyer Bhanu Pratap Singh who gave the speech to the crowd sitting in the protest of NRC-CAA after the verdict of the Supreme Court.

We too check the official site of Himalaya to know the name of the owner of the company and found his name to be Mr. M Manal.
