In a strong rebuke on Christmas Day, Major Archbishop Cardinal Basilios Cleemis of the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church criticized the 'contradiction' in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s outreach to Christians. While PM Modi attended a morning service at the Cathedral Church of the Redemption in New Delhi, the Cardinal highlighted recent attacks on the community, specifically the assault on a carol group in Kerala’s Palakkad by an RSS worker. Speaking to India Today’s Shibimol KG, the Archbishop stated, 'On one side, Prime Minister is taking part in Christmas celebrations... In another place, the opposite is happening.' The prelate questioned the efficacy of government assurances when violence continues, noting that despite raising issues with those in power, 'when it comes to putting those statements in action, they have failed.' The remarks come as the BJP attempts to woo the Christian electorate in Kerala ahead of upcoming elections.
