Amid the global coronavirus pandemic, many events, including the Tokyo Olympics 2020, have been cancelled or postponed.

Now, an image is doing the rounds on social media with the claim that the Tokyo Olympics logo has been redesigned in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. The "new logo" shows the rings placed separately instead of interlaced, suggesting the idea of social distancing during the pandemic.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false. The Tokyo Olympics logo has not been redesigned.

However, it was reported that a designer did propose this new logo for the Tokyo Olympics 2020 with the message 'Practice safe social distance'. But, we could not find any news report saying that the Olympics committee accepted the proposal and redesigned the symbol. Had the iconic Olympics symbol been redesigned, it would have been reported widely in the media.

The Olympics symbol consists of five interlaced rings, representing the union of the five continents. On Tuesday, the Tokyo Olympics 2020 was postponed by one year due to the coronavirus pandemic.
