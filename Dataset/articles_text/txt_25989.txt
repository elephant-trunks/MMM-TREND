A picture of a very young kid amid the rubble is doing rounds on the internet. Social media users are claiming the child survived a massive earthquake in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, sharing the picture a user named @Zabih_Uallah wrote the caption, “Afghanistan was buried in the rubble for about 24 hours after the earthquake and was found alive by the grace of God.”

Similarly, many other users have shared this picture with the same claim.



Fact Check

On reverse image search we found the same picture on the website of almasdaronline. The article was published on December 10, 2015, with the title, “Yemeni activists send a message to the participants in the Yemeni negotiations: Stop the war.” Therefore, this picture is old and is not related to the earthquake in Afghanistan.

Moreover, we also found a Facebook post with a similar picture of January 6, 2015. Further, the caption of the picture was in Arabic which can be nearly translated into English, “I had a home here. They destroyed it and made me homeless.”

Conclusion

Therefore, from our fact-check analysis, it is clear that this picture is not of Afghanistan but of Yemen. And, users are sharing the picture with the misleading claim.
