A piece of news by Indian Express is going viral on the internet. The report claims that “the DGPs of the BSF, CRPF, CISF, ITB, AND SSB were not invited to the Republic Day parade. The omission is perceived as a snub to the one odd million personnel of the central forces.”

Similarly, many other media houses and social media users posted this news on their handles.

FactCheck

On our FactCheck analysis, our team found this information is false. Firstly, we found a tweet on the official Twitter handles of the CRPF that, “The information published in @IndianExpress that DG CRPF was not invited to Republic Day Parade is not just incorrect but also ill intended and insulting to the Force. Shri Kuldiep Singh, DG CRPF, was invited to the Republic Day Parade which he attended.”

After that, we also found the tweet of CISF, along with the caption, “DG #CISF Sh. Sheel Vardhan Singh was invited & attended the 73rd #RepublicDay parade at Rajpath, New Delhi. The information published in news paper stating that DsG of CAPF were not invited at the Republic Day Parade 2022 is incorrect.”

Moreover, ITBP also to its official Twitter handle to refute this news. They wrote, “A newspaper published today a piece that DsG of CAPFs were not invited at the Republic Day Parade 2022. It is clarified that the DG ITBP was invited & attended the Parade. It was for the 1st time that the ‘Janbaz’ bikers of ITBP displayed a brave show at the parade.”

Hence, seeing all the above tweet it’s clear that all CISF, CRPF and ITBP quashed the Indian Express news.
