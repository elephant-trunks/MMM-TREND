India Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is from Services Hospital in Lahore, Pakistan, and not from India. It is from the time when a fire broke out in a surgical emergency ward of the hospitals and patients evacuated from the building.

To verify the claim with the viral video, we ran a reverse search on one of the keyframes and found many media reports . According to these reports, the video is from Services Hospital in Lahore, Pakistan, where a fire broke out in the surgical emergency ward on June 13.

The patients on the beds outside the hospital were rescued from this fire which took away the life of one woman, leaving eight others injured.

As per media reports these were not corona patients. A journalist from Pakistan also took to Twitter asking people not to spread fake news.
