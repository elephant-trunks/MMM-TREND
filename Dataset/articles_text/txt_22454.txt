Amid the tension in North-East Delhi following the violence, social media is flooded with several videos of vandalism and police action. While some videos have links with the recent incidents of Delhi, a few of them are old and unrelated.

A video of police lathi-charge has recently gone viral on Facebook, claiming to be from Delhi.

Facebook users such as Rahul Avasthi, Amit Goyal and Aman Kumar have posted this video with a caption in Hindi, saying the cleaning process in Delhi has begun. The video shows policemen suddenly attacking a mob in a narrow bylane and charging them with batons.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this to be a misleading post. The video is not from Delhi. This incident of police lathi-charge took place in Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh, in December last year.

With the help of InVid verification tool, we sliced up the viral video into keyframes. Then using reverse image search, we found that the viral video had featured in a news clip of a YouTube news channel called 'SPN NEWS'.

The YouTube channel had uploaded this clip on December 20, 2019. The caption and the details of the video say this is the video of police lathi-charge in Bulandshahr against the anti-CAA protesters.

This incident of police lathi-charge against the anti-CAA protesters on December 20, 2019, was also reported by several news websites like NDTV India.

According to these reports, the anti- CAA protest took an ugly turn in Bulandshahr on December 20, 2019, when several vehicles were torched by the protesters. A heavy police force was deployed in the area and police resorted to lathi-charge to control them.

Hence, it is confirmed that the viral video of police lathi-charge is not from Delhi, but Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh.
