A video is being widely shared on social media with a claim that it shows the visuals of Jagannath’s Rath Yatra. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.

Claim: Video shows the visuals of Jagannath’s Rath Yatra. Fact: The posted video is not related to Jagannath’s Rath Yatra. It is an old video related to the Madurai Chithirai festival. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.

When the screenshots of the video were through Google Reverse Image Search, many such videos were found in the search results. A Twitter user posted a similar video in April 2022 with the description – “#ChithiraiThiruvizha The Annual Chariot-Festival #Madurai #MeenakshiAmman Temple, #TamilNadu #MaduraiChithiraiFestival2022”. However, the same video was also found to be uploaded on YouTube in 2018 with the title – “MEENATCHI CHITHIRAI THIRUVIZHA 2018 DAY 11. (THEROTTAM.) MADURAI MANVASAM”.

Also, in another video related to the 2018 Madurai Chithirai festival, a similar chariot can be seen. More details regarding the Madurai Chithirai festival can be found here, here, and here.

The actual visuals related to recent Jagannath’s Rath Yatra in Puri can be seen here and here.

To sum it up, an old video related to the Madurai Chithirai festival is shared as the visuals of Jagannath’s Rath Yatra.
