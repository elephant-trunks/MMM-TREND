A screen grab of Aajtak news channel is being circulated in several WhatsApp groups, with the claim that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced liquor ban in the entire country from tonight.

The viral image has a picture of PM Modi addressing the nation along with a breaking news graphics in Hindi saying: "aaj raat se poore Bharat mein sharab bandh".

The image also bears the logo of Aajtak channel. The top band says "desh ke naam Modi ka sambodhan - part 2".

This is an old hoax from 2017 which has resurfaced after Modi's recent electoral victory. There are several points that show it is a poorly photoshopped image.

First, the red graphics plate saying "aaj raat se poore Bharat mein sharab bandh" has been abysmally juxtaposed over an Aajtak screen grab.

The parts of the original logo of Aajtak in the screen grab are still visible behind the photoshopped logo.

The customised time clock beneath the Aajtak logo is also missing. Along the borders of the image, currency notes can be seen in the background, indicating that the morphed image of Aajtak has been laid over some other image.

Last but not the least, this picture of PM Modi is from 2017 New Year's speech. Aajtak never telecast any such news.
