Spread the truth:

This was launched in March 2014 only for Mumbai Women & was shutdown in March 2017 because of poor response

Use of Modi Ji’s photo is irrelevant as this number was launched in March 2014 for Mumbai Women when Modi Ji was neither Maharashtra’s CM, nor India’s PM. This number was launched by Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria.

This doesn’t work any more. Tried sending a SMS and got a reply from Mumbai Police to call “100”. On calling 9969777888, it said “This Number does not exist”.

Under ‘Travel Safe When Alone’ initiative, any women before taking an auto rickshaw or taxi could message the registration number of the vehicle to a dedicated helpline number 9969777888.

“Police will keep the track of the vehicles that the woman is taking and would get her location through GPS,” Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria said while launching the service on the occasion of the International Women’s Day.

The service, jointly started by the MTNL, is free-of-cost.

Maria said in case of any untoward incident happening with the woman traveller, this service will be very useful in detecting the case.

The initiative is launched against the backdrop of sexual assault and murder of Andhra Pradesh techie Esther Anuhya recently.

“….This service has become all the more important after recent Esther Anuhya murder case,” Maria said.

Launched by Rakesh Maria in March 2014:
