Spread the truth:

A page under name of Green Tiger – Akbaruddin Owasi, supposedly ran by his fans has posted a disturbing video of people lynching 3 men out of which one is disabled claiming to be a mob of Gau-rakshaks.

The video link is given below, you can (rather not) should listen to. It’s all in Punjabi, swaer words, not even sure if it’s India or Pakistan.

The purpose is not clear in video but it seems these three were caught sealing something, cattle may be.

THE ONLY THING CONFIRMED HERE IS THE VIDEO WAS POSTED 5 YEARS BACK I.E. 2012.
