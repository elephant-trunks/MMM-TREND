A video of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has gone viral where he’s seen asking a person to move away during a public event. Several social media users have claimed that this was deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya who was “insulted” by Yogi.

The 13-second clip was shot from behind and one cannot clearly see the face of the man who was chided by Yogi.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the man who was rebuked by Yogi was not Maurya but a local BJP leader named Vibhrat Chand Kaushik. Maurya was not even present at the event.
