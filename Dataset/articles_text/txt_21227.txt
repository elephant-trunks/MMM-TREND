Amid the Karnataka hijab row, a video has gone viral, in which, a group of young men can be seen throwing buckets of water on burqa-clad women.

Several social media users shared this video with the claim that the video showed extremist Hindu men throwing dirty water at Muslim women.

Muslim girls have been tortured on the streets of India for the last 4 days. Due to wearing hijab in religious dress. The video shows extremist Hindu people throwing dirty water on Muslim girls on the side of the road. https://t.co/p1HSr6NMlL" >pic.twitter.com/p1HSr6NMlL a> — Shahinur Alam Sumon (@modern_sas) https://twitter.com/ modern_sas/status/ 1491684605216407554?ref_src= twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2022

While some have claimed that these young men are members of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, others claimed them to be members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, a student organisation affiliated to the RSS.

India Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the claims misleading. The video has nothing to do with the ongoing hijab row. In fact, this video is not from India. It is an old video from Sri Lanka.

AFWA PROBE

Using InVid and reverse image search, we traced the source of the video. A few social media users had shared this video in February 2019. They claimed the video showed Eastern University students in Sri Lanka hazing juniors.

Subsequently, we did a keyword search and found the same video published with the same claim on a Facebook page called Lanka Sun-News on February 24, 2019.

The video was also published by Puthithu — a news website run by Sri Lankan Tamils living abroad — on February 24, 2019. The report claimed that its reporter had confirmed with Eastern University students that the video was indeed filmed on their campus.

So, we can safely conclude that the video has no connection with the ongoing hijab row in Karnataka. The video was shot in 2019 in Sri Lanka and showed students of Eastern University hazing other students.
