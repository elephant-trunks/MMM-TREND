Fact Check

To know the truth behind the viral video we did some research and found a video on YouTube. The video was uploaded on 10th October 2021 having the same scene as you saw in the viral video. The video was uploaded by Aakib Abbas and he gave a caption, “हरियाणा में किसान भाइयों ने खट्टर का जन कार्यक्रम तोड़ फोड़ करके रद किया।। – YouTube “ which roughly translate in English that the riot was created in Haryana CM, Manohar Lal Khattar’s party convection.

After digging deep, we found much news on this riot which was published on 10th October 2021. The program was held to aware farmers of the benefits of 3 Farmer’s Law. Alas! The farmers arrived at the venue first and did the act of sabotage on stage.
