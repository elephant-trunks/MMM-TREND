A disturbing video, along with a few pictures, are going viral on social media where a man in blood-stained shirt is seen walking around, holding the severed head of a man.

Many social media users shared the post claiming that this man in Chennai did a commendable job by killing his sister's rapist and going to the police station with the severed head.

Facebook user "Suraj Singh" wrote in broken English, "jio sher! Comment for Good/Bad. In Chennai, a brother cut off an accused head, who raped his sister and carried the severed head to police station, please circulate this message in all groups so that people who have this kind of intention in their minds will think 100 times before doing the act, that this can happen to them also".

The viral post on Facebook

India Today's Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this to be a misleading claim. The beheading incident took place last year in Karnataka and it has nothing to do with rape.

The same content is viral on Facebook and also available on Twitter.

With the help of reverse search, we found that several media outlets and newspapers had reported the incident. According to these reports, the incident took place on September 29, 2018, in Mandya district of Karnataka.

As per The Times of India, "The accused, Pashupathi, walked into the police station with the severed head of his friend Girish. According to police, the accused said Girish had spoken ill of his mother which sparked a clash between the two. Later, he allegedly beheaded him and surrendered before police."

The incident has neither any connection to Chennai nor with rape. The gory images of an old incident are now viral on social media with a wrong narrative.
