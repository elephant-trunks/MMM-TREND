A video is being shared widely on social media with the following claim – “This Sanghi asked a woman to remove cloth covering head, because he thought only Muslim ladies do that, watch the response he got”. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.

Claim: Video of a man getting thrashed for asking a woman to remove her head covering (hijab). Fact: The man in the video was thrashed for misbehaving with the woman. None of the news reports mention him asking the woman to remove the head covering. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.

When the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, news reports regarding the incident in the video were found in the search results. According to the ‘NaiDunia’ article, the incident took place in Madhya Pradesh. The man in the video was reportedly thrashed for misbehaving with the woman. In the video, one can also hear the woman challenging him to touch her while beating.

More information regarding the incident can be also read here, here, and here. The news agencies reported the incident to be a case of molestation. None of the news reports mentioned that the man getting thrashed in the video asked the woman to remove the head covering.

To sum it up, the man in the posted video was beaten for misbehaving with a woman, not for asking her to remove her head covering.
