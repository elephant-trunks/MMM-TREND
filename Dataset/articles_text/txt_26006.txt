A piece of news is going viral on the internet that the Pradhan Mantri Jan Kalyan department is giving Rs 5000 to the people who are vaccinated. Further, Twitter user Arun Sharma shared a link on his handle. And, wrote the caption which can be nearly translated into English, “An important notice – those who got vaccinated Prime Minister’s Welfare department is giving Rs 5000 to them. If you have also got the corona vaccine Fill out the form now and get Rs 5000. Fill out the form from this link.”

(“एक आवश्यक सूचना* – जिन्होंने वैक्सीन लगा लिया उन्हें 5000 रु प्रधानमंत्री जन कल्याण विभाग द्वारा दिया जा रहा है, आपने भी कोरोना का वैक्सीन लगा लिया है तो अभी फॉर्म भरें और 5000 रू प्राप्त करें इस लिंक से फॉर्म भरें”)

Fact Check

While clicking on the link it first asks you for some details like the email id, total members of the family, and the name of the vaccine you took. Then, after that, it asks you the way through which you want the take your money. Further, in the end, it asks you to confirm and share this with your 5 WhatsApp contacts and groups.

Since no government portal asks to share the link with your WhatsApp contact this site was not appearing to be genuine. Then, on keyword research also, we didn’t find any such news. Further, we checked on various government portals but there is no such official information.

Conclusion

Therefore, the link in the post is fake. And, there is no such announcement by the government.
