A picture is going viral on social media sites. By sharing this picture, users are claiming that the glaciers of Antarctica are visible from space.

A user named حيدرة Space 8K captioned, “Antarctica seen from space!” and tweeted a picture in which that shows an incomplete globe and a large part of it is seen with a sheet of ice.

Fact Check:

To know the reality of this viral picture, we searched the internet in this context. We found the image uploaded on the NASA website on September 21, 2005. In this picture it is written that the original photo of Antarctica was found from space. This picture is completely different from the picture going viral. The image of NASA is visible directly on the globe. While the viral picture has been tarnished.

At the same time, some users have also given sarcastic feedback on this. Bomber Bayl wrote, “Don’t look like it’s melting to me as some reports say.”

Horace Granero wrote, “Don’t see any melting polar cap there, plenty of ice. Global warming? No.”

Conclusion:

It is clear from this fact check of DFRAC that the picture going viral is edited/photoshopped, hence the claim being made by the users is fake.
