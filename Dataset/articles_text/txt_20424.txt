Fact Check

On our fact check analysis, we found the same video on the You Tube channel of Ranchi Clips. Moreover, the video was uploaded on March 25, 2018 with the caption Ramnavmi live at Ranchi.

Further, we also found the same video on the Youtube channel of Chanchal’s Biology with the caption,”Ramnavami 2019 Ranchi.”

Hence, it is clear that this is an old video but users are sharing it the wrong claim. There was no such news of choppering showering flowers the on the eve of the Hindu New Year celebrations.
