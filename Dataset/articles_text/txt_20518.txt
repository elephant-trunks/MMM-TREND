Fact check

After cross-checking, we found Nadiya Savchenko first female pilot of Ukraine. She is a present politician in Ukraine Parliament and has worked in the army till 2014 after that she became the Ukraine delegate to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in January 2015. Last but most important she is alive as well. People are spreading the fake picture as well the claim of her demise.

The article of the Los Angeles Times covered the news where she got freed in 2016 by Russian authority after spending two years behind the bar. She was imprisoned for killing two Russian Journalists.

After seeing the picture, it is clear that the viral picture is not matching with the original picture of the first female pilot.
