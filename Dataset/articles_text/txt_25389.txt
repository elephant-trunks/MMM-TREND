Spread the truth:

Is Kapil Sibal going to fight case for the Rapist Ram Rahim in Supreme Court ?

Well বানীব্রত দাশগুপ্ত seems to says so. Politics is unpredictable so you never know, he may fight too, but there is no such news out yet and this person is using a photo for proof which actually is Director Mahesh Bhatt and Not Kapil Sibal.

Yes, they do look alike from this angle and anyone can fall for it.

And this could be a reason why he believed the person in photo to be Kapil Sibal –

Ironically almost entire Bollywood met this ex-baba to wish him for his Movie MSG 2.
