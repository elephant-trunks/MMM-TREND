Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday flagged off the BJP’s “Vijay Yatra” in Kasaragod district of poll-bound Kerala. Amid this, a picture of a large gathering of people forming the BJP symbol lotus is being circulated on social media linking it to the event.

The picture is being shared with the caption, “Pic of the day from #Kerala. #KeralaWelcomesYogiJi”.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the picture to be misleading. Though Yogi’s Kasaragod rally on February 21 witnessed massive crowds, this particular picture was taken in April 2015 when BJP workers in Gujarat’s Dahod were celebrating the party’s foundation day.

The same claim is being circulated on Facebook as well. The archived version of the viral tweet can be seen here.

AFWA investigation

With the help of reverse image search, we found the picture in a report by “The Indian Express” on April 7, 2015. It says that BJP workers gathered at a college ground in Gujarat’s Dahod and formed a huge party flag to celebrate the BJP’s 35th foundation day on April 6, 2015.

As per the report, around 25,000 BJP workers, dressed in green, saffron, black and white, formed this “human flag”.

Other media houses, including news agency ANI, had also reported the incident.

At that time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also tweeted a similar picture showing the complete “human flag”. A video of the event is also available on the Internet.

An innovative way to mark BJP's 'Sthapana Diwas.' Congrats to the Karyakartas. http://t.co/DlxyrMzbX8 pic.twitter.com/HXmPnE5Eob — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) April 6, 2015

Pictures from Yogi’s Kasaragod rally on February 21 have been shared on the official Twitter handle of Kerala BJP and can be seen here.

Hence, it can be concluded that the claim along with the viral picture is misleading. The picture is almost six years old and not from Yogi’s rally in Kerala on Sunday, which too witnessed mammoth crowds.
