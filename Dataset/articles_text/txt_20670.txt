A piece of News is in the air where a Facebook user named Debasish Banik has posted a poster that states in UP’s Gorakhpur world longest LPG pipeline are coming whose net worth is 10,000 crore. The poster was posted on 17th January 2022.

Another Page name ‘Modi Once More’ posted the same.

Fact Check

Site pictures under the posters are false and misleading as the picture of the pipeline, crane, and construction site is from Germany and not Gorakhpur, UP. GettyImages is a British-American media-visual company that supplies stock images, editorial photography, etc. The picture posted was taken from this website. The image is of 8th April 2010 near Lumbin, Germany.

Hence proving the image of the construction site is from Germany and not from Gorakhpur.
