This is also from BJP rally only as PM Modi’s face and BJP colors can be seen on banners, but this image was used in Jan 2018 by someone else claiming to be from Independent MLA Hanuman Beniwal’s Kisan Hunkar Rally

This BJP Rally was a wrongly featured image of a video uploaded on Youtube by a Beniwal Supporter.

8th Jan 2018, Firstpost reported

Barmer (Rajasthan): Independent MLA Hanuman Beniwal has attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi while announcing that Rajasthan needed a new political party to provide an alternative to both the BJP and the Congress.

Hanuman Beniwal made the announcement at a huge rally of farmers in Barmer on Sunday. He said the youths had seen through both the major political outfits and “their false promises” and were looking for a change.

Beniwal asked people to refrain from getting lured by promises he said Modi would make at Pachpadra while laying the foundation stone of the Barmer Refinery.
