In 2015-16, 54% women in rural areas between the ages of 15-49 years were anaemic--an indicator of poor health and poor nutrition, down from 58% in 2005-06, according to government data.

Anaemia in pregnant women in rural areas fell from 59% in 2005-06 to 52% in 2015-16.

Anaemia is the world’s second leading cause of disability, and is one of the most common preventable causes of death in children under five years and pregnant women in malaria-endemic countries, according to data from the World Health Organization.
