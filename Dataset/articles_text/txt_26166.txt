Further, caption reads, “Congress is giving a unique gift to the Hindus who had voted for the Congress in Rajasthan. Accept happily (now Namaz will be offered in Kumbhalgadh, the pride of Mewar).Ashok Gehlot did what Akbar could not do . Rajasthan government allowed ijtema in Kumbhalgarh fort of Maharana Pratap. Only possible if Congress is there, destruction of Hindu culture.”
