Note that Aditi Singh was suspended from the Congress’s Women Party Wing. The news report by Times Now Digital on 21st May, 2020 read, “Congress suspends Aditi Singh from women’s wing, after Raebareli MLA slammed party for ‘fraud’”.

The suspension came days after she posted the viral picture on Twitter.

To be more clear we did a Google search with the keywords to see if there are any media reports of Aditi Singh joining the Bhartiya Janata Party, we did not come across such reports neither are there any official confirmations about the same.

Hence, it is established that Aditi Singh has not joined the Bhartiya Janata Party after being suspended from Congress, it is also to be noted that the viral picture is an old picture that she posted on Mother’s Day. The viral claims are absolutely false.
