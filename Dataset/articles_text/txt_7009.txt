Days after quitting the Congress, Gujarat Patidar leader Hardik Patel joined the ranks of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday. Meanwhile, a video of the new recruit in the saffron camp has gone viral on social media with the claim that he was 'welcomed' with a slap.

In the seven-second-long muted video, Patel is slapped by a man while speaking from a stage.

Users have shared this video alongside a caption in Hindi that translates to, "Warm welcome and greeting to Hardik Patel as soon as he joins BJP."

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. This video shows Hardik Patel getting slapped more than three years ago when he was still with the Congress party.

A keyword search on Google showed multiple news reports published in April 2019 -- suggesting that the incident is not recent.

An article in 'The Economic Times' from April 19, 2019, noted that Patel was delivering his speech at Gujarat's Surendranagar district for the Lok Sabha elections when he was slapped by an unidentified man.

As the logo of 'Hindustan Times' was visible in the viral video, we searched for the original one and found it uploaded on April 19. We found the now viral part 12 seconds into this original version.

According to a report published in India Today, the man who slapped Patel was later identified as Tarun Gajjar. It also noted that Gajjar had some personal grudge against the Patidar leader and hence slapped him.

Hardik Patel, the young face of the Patidar caste of Gujarat, made his political debut with Congress in 2019. Now, his move to the BJP months before the state assembly polls has further dented the aspirations of the Congress party to seize power in the saffron fort.

Thus, it is safe to conclude that the video of Hardik Patel getting slapped was not shot after he joined the BJP but from 2019 when he was a member of Congress.
