We started the investigation by conducting a Google Reverse Image Search by taking a screenshot of this aforementioned picture. As a result, we found News published by NDTV (NDTV Hyperlink in Hindi doc is not opening) on 6th March 2016. The title of this News reads: This photograph is of an accused from an incident that took place in Thane, Mumbai. The accused, Hasnain Warekar, killed 14 members of his family in Thane, Mumbai on the morning of 28th February 2016 and later killed himself.

Conclusion: On the basis of our investigation, we found the above post wrong. A photograph of the person who died in 2016 is being portrayed and spread as a victim who was kidnapped and raped by three women in Telangana. The kidnapping and rape incident originally took place in South Africa in 2017 and the above photograph is also not related to this incident.
