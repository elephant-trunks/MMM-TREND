To verify the claim with the viral video, we segregated it into keyframes and ran a reverse search on one of them. We found the video on video-sharing social networking service TikTok, shared by a user with display name Zara Khan and TikTok handle @shivanisarkar4.

She shared the video on December 22, 2019. Many of her fans enquired about the injury, to which she replied that she met with a car accident but is fine now.

Zara has more than 52,400 followers on TikTok and this particular video received over 8.55 lakh likes. We tried to contact Zara through her Instagram account. We will update the story when she responds.
