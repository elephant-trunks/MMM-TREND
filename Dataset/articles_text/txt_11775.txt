The video is not of a protest in either France or Chechnya as claimed, it’s actually from Yemen, where the crowd had gathered to celebrate the Prophet’s birthday.

A reverse image search led us to an article by Iranian online news aggregator, AhlulBayt News Agency carrying the visuals from the video.

The article stated that photos were from the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), which was observed in Sana'a, Yemen.
