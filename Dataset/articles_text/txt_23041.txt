The spat between the two top Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officers has turned into a full-blown war, shaking up the agency from within. The government has sent both Alok Verma and his deputy Rakesh Asthana on leave after an ongoing fight between them. Social media, too, felt the tremor as a result of the explosion that rocked the country.

Till Tuesday, a barrage of tweets were posted in favour of former special director of CBI, Rakesh Asthana. Hashtags such as #RakeshAsthanaSupport and #CBIvsCBI began to trend on Twitter. However, on Wednesday, several handles favouring Asthana have switched loyalties to CBI officer AK Sharma.

On Tuesday, India Today Fact Check team found most of the Twitter handles supporting Asthana suspicious.

Within 24 hours, we observed that the handles that tweeted in favour of Asthana under #RakeshAsthanaSupport, were tweeting in support of Sharma under #AKSharmaHonestMan.

Like Asthana, Sharma is also a Gujarat-cadre IPS officer. He was the Joint Director of CBI. However, on Wednesday, Sharma was transferred along with other CBI officers after the controversy snowballed.

According to media report, Sharma was close to former CBI director Alok Verma.

The sudden support for Asthana and then for Sharma raised suspicion among netizens. Many hinted bots behind these flurry of Twitter activities.

Now #AKSharmaHonestMan is trending on Twitter. Yesterday it was #CBIvsAlokVerma before that #RakeshAsthanaSupport. Suspicious how the Gujarat cadre faction in CBI is being backed up by a social media firm with an army of bots targeting Alok Verma. Aditya Menon (@AdityaMenon22) October 23, 2018

India Today Fact Check team found same Twitter handles first poured support for Asthana and later Sharma in a gap of a day.

A close look at the pattern of the tweets, we found some glaring similarities in the posts in both the hastags - #AKSharmaHonestMan and #RakeshAsthanaSupport. In both cases, most of these dubious handles fired tweets on the same time.

Like for the #AKSharmaHonestMan, these tweets were posted almost at the same time on October 23. The same pattern was found in the tweets for #RakeshAsthanaSupport posted on October 21.

After closely monitoring the profiles, posts and bios of these Twitter handles, we found that the information and pictures given are mostly fictitious.

Interestingly, almost all handles have a huge number of followers, ranging from 10,000 to 90,000, and they mostly promote each other's posts on a trending subject.
