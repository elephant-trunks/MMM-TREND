Truth

This was a protest by Shiv Sena against Jarnail Bhindrawale and were shouting “Atankwaad Hai Hai” in the favor of country.

It’s pretty strange how did they find Indian Tricolor Flag and heard Bharat Hai Hai, or is it intentional lie ?

Complete Video from June 2017 –

The Hindustan Times Says –

“Right-wing leader Sudhir Kumar Suri, who burnt effigy of slain militant preacher Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale on 33rd anniversary of Operation Bluestar, was arrested by police on Sunday for allegedly hurting religious sentiments.

Suri, president of Shiv Sena Hindustan, was arrested from his Shivala Colony house around 11.00 am.

He has been booked under sections 153-A , 295-A, 148 and 149 (unlawful assembly) of the IPC. On June 6, Suri and his aides staged protest at the Ghah Mandi Chowk and burnt Bhindranwale’s effigy. He is also accused of making objectionable remarks against ‘nihangs’.

The complaint was filed by Sikh Students Federation (SSF) leader Amarbir Singh Dhot.

Tension had prevailed in the holy city on June 6 and 7 and a clash between the two communities was averted after timely intervention by police.”
