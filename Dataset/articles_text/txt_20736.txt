A picture widely getting viral on social media claims that Muslims are returning home to Sanatan Dharma after Waseem Rizvi’s conversion from Islam to Sanatan Dharma.

One user claimed that 34 Muslim families in UP are coming back home to Sanatan Dharma.

Another user claimed that after Waseem Rizvi’s return home to Sanatan Dharma is causing fear among Muslims and 34 Muslim families are voluntarily converting to Sanatan Dharma.

Fact Check

On checking this picture, it was found that this picture was taken on September 18. After the Uri attack, people of the local Muslim community had gathered at the Shahi Jama Masjid to protest against Pakistan. We also got a report that was published by Amar Ujala in this regard.

According to the report, during that time the Imam of the mosque, Mohammad Omar Qadri and Mahamandaleshwar Naval Giri raised slogans of “Bharat mata ki jai”, “Hindustan Zindabad” and “Pakistan Murdabad”.

Hence, the claim made in these pictures is false.
