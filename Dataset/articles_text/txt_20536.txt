UP Elections have reached their 6th phase and today CM Yogi Adityanath will face assembly election as a contestant in Gorakhpur. CM Yogi is found confident over winning 80% of seats in UP.

Meanwhile, a claim is getting viral on social media by Rajhuraj Pratap Singh MLA from Kunda District in Uttar Pradesh. He claimed that SP president Akhilesh Yadav has shared a video from Haryana and claimed that a man is caught doing illegal activities on the Kunda election booth. SP President also appealed to cancel the assembly polling in Kunda.

Rajhuraj Pratap Singh posted the tweet with embedding Akhilesh Yadav’s tweet inserting a picture on 1st March 2022.

आदरणीय ⁦@yadavakhilesh⁩ जी, आप एक दल के राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष हैं और वरिष्ठ राजनेता भी, उक्त वीडियो 2019 के चुनाव का हरियाणा का है जिसे आप कुण्डा का बताकर चुनाव निरस्त करने की माँग कर रहे हैं, राजनीति में इतनी घृणा भी अच्छी नहीं होती। pic.twitter.com/NyBiv6yoAs — Raja Bhaiya (@Raghuraj_Bhadri) March 1, 2022

Fact check

After checking the authenticity of the tweet, we found no such tweet on the Twitter profile of Akhilesh Yadav. We only found one tweet where he wrote that goon’s governance will stop and people from different caste will work together in Kunda. He also claimed that the people of Kunda will demand no BJP in this election. The tweet was made on 27th February 2022. He also inserted a video of Bharat Samachar which covered news of SP candidate Gulshan Yadav from Pratapgarh being attacked in Kunda during the polling.

Therefore the claim is fake and the picture is edited.
