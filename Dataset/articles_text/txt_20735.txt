News18 anchor Amish Devgan claimed in his program that Mughal emperor Shah Jahan had all the workers’ hands cut off after the Taj Mahal was built.

While tweeting video related to this program, he said that Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan had got the hands of the workers who built the Taj Mahal cut off, and PM Modi showered flowers on the workers who built the Kashi Vishwanath Dham.

मुग़ल बादशाह शाहजहाँ ने ताजमहल को बनाने वाले मज़दूरों के हाथ कटवाए थे, और भव्य काशी धाम बनाने वाले मज़दूरों पर PM मोदी ने फूल बरसाए हैं । pic.twitter.com/hXQkewb58u — Amish Devgan (@AMISHDEVGAN) December 13, 2021

Fact Check

When we inquired about the above claim, we found that Shah Jahan had not got the hands of the laborers who built the Taj Mahal be cut off. Rather, by giving them a lifetime salary, he made them promise to not work for life. In this regard, a report of Aaj Tak and Live Hindustan has also been found, in which this claim has been called false.

Hence, this claim is false and misleading.
