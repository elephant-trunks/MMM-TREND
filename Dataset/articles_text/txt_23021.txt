In the midst of political hustle and bustle in Ayodhya, parties are scrambling to make the most of it. The pitch for Ram mandir is also growing louder on all social media sites.

Among the viral images and videos, a photograph showing a huge crowd of saffron-clad workers is being circulated widely. One picture claimed that "thousands gathered at Ayodhya demanding the construction of Ram mandir". Similar messages are also being shared on different Facebook pages.

India Today Fact Check team found that the claim associated with the photo and the video is misleading. The picture is not from Ayodhya. The image dates back to August 2017 when the Maratha Kranti Morcha protested in Mumbai demanding reservation in jobs and education for the Maratha community.

When we reverse-searched the photo, it showed many results directing us to the articles related to Maratha Kranti Morcha protest rally in Mumbai.

Among the many websites, which used this particular picture, were mid-day.com and amarujala.com. Hence, it is clear that the photo is not from Ayodhya but from Mumbai.

The video that went viral shows a large number of people waving saffron flags near a mosque. Some netizens are claiming that the video is from Ayodhya.

However, we found that the video is from Rama Navami Shobha Yatra held in Karnataka's Gulbarga city (now Kalaburagi) in March this year.

When we searched the video using In-vid tool, many results came up showing that the video is from Rama Navami Shobha Yatra in Gulbarga. The religious place which can be seen in the video is Syed Shah Yunus Quadri (RA) located at Quadri chowk in Gulbarga.

A close look at the video shows a bus with "Karnataka state reserve police" written on it. This helped us to confirm that the video is from Karnataka. Our local correspondent also confirmed this.
