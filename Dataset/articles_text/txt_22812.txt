A photo collage of BJP MLA from Hyderabad's Goshamahal T Raja Singh, along with a woman is being circulated on the social media with the claim that his sister Maya Devi has converted to Islam.

The photo is being circulated on Facebook pages under the masthead of a media house and with grammatically erroneous text over it that reads, "Hyderabad BJP MLA Raja Singh's sister Maya Devi accepted Islam."

According to the post, her brother separated from her after she converted to Islam.

By the time of filing this story, the post was shared by more than a thousand users. The archived version of the post can be seen here.

AFWA has found that the claim is misleading. MLA T Raja Singh has no real sister.

The collage contains a couple of photographs of a woman; in one, she is wearing the hijab.

There is a watermark of "Asianet News" on the image.

On reverse search, we found that the woman whose picture is being circulated as MLA's sister is Athira, a Hindu woman from Kerala's Kasargod district.

She had converted to Islam back in 2017 after leaving home. She had changed her name to Ayesha.

The incident was widely covered by Indian media.

After a few months, however, Athira re-converted to Hinduism.

We found her interview in Malayalam uploaded on the official YouTube channel of "Asianet news" back in July 28, 2017.

We spoke to BJP MLA T Raja Singh, who confirmed that he has no sister named Maya Devi.

This is not the first time Singh has become the target of such communal mischief.

According to an article published in "The News Minute", in 2015 he became a victim of a similar propaganda that his niece had converted to Islam.

Then he had filed a complaint with Central Crime Station (CCS) against one Mohammed Aslam Khan and 'The Milli Gazette', an English fortnightly newspaper, for this conspiracy.
