A disturbing image of a woman hanging from a tree and a toddler's body floating in a pond is going viral on social media with the claim that this is the plight of people in "Atmanirbhar Bharat".

The term "Atmanirbhar Bharat" has gained traction after Prime Minister Narendra Modi used it several times in one of his recent addresses to the nation to drive home the point that India should become self-reliant in this time of crisis arising out of the coronavirus pandemic.

Twitter user Rayaan Ali posted the picture with a caption in Hindi that translates to, "This picture of self-reliant India will bring tears of blood in your eyes."

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the picture to be untrue. The picture is not from India, but Bangladesh.

The image with the false claim is also going viral on Facebook. The archived version can be seen here.

Using Google reverse image search, we found that many Bengali news website have used similar pictures in their articles while reporting the incident.

As per Bangla Tribune, an online newspaper in Bangladesh, the incident took place recently in Noakhali district of the country.

On May 29, police recovered the bodies of a woman named Bibi Mariam and her two-and-a-half-month-old daughter. Mariam's brother alleged that she often had altercations with her husband over his extra-marital affair, and which is why she was killed along with the baby.

Another report said all the family members of the deceased woman's husband had absconded after the incident. A Bangladeshi newspaper called the daily observer had also covered the incident.

Therefore, it can be said that the picture used in the viral claim has no relation to India. It was an incident in Noakhali district of Bangladesh.
