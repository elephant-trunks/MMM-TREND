Truth

Tiktok, a Chinese owned app with over 1.5 billion downloads worldwide, is banned for United States Army soldiers, not entire country. The ban came in December 2019. The soldiers could not use the app on government-owned devices. The move was done amidst the worry that the Chinese owned app could comprise national security.

“It is considered a cyber threat,” Army spokeswoman Lt. Col. Robin Ochoa told Military.com, which broke the news on December 30th, 2019. Both the Navy and Defense Department sounded alarms on TikTok in early December, 2019.

The Navy previously told its members not to add the app, and to delete it from government-issued devices if it was already installed. The Defense Department also instructed employees to “be wary of applications you download, monitor your phones for unusual and unsolicited texts, etc., and delete them immediately and uninstall TikTok to circumvent any exposure of personal information,” according to military.com

Hence, the claim that the TikTok app has been banned completely in the United States of America is false. It is to be noted that the app is only banned for the US Army.
