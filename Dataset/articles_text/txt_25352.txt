Spread the truth:

To save oneself from fake news, there are two basic necessitates – Common Sense and Open Mind.

Both are defeated badly in this case. More than 8000 people shared this post –

Have a close look at the photo of the cheque and give your above mentioned necessities a try

Let’s see how this can not be true –

1. Top Left – No cross on right top corner which makes this cheque non account payee i.e Cheque to withdraw cash, So can one withdraw 98 Crore cash from Bank ?

2. Top Left – North Lakhimpur Assam Branch. Why would Nirav Modi, who dealt entire life in Mumbai, will use Assam Branch ?

3. Top Right – Check the date “25/09/2011”. So this cheque has been lying around for 7.5 years, not used ? Don’t you wonder why ?

4. Middle Left – Ninety is misspelled as “Ninenty”. Can a Wharton dropout Nirav Modi make this mistake, especially in such important cheque ?

5. Bottom Right – The Name under the signature (which too is fake) has been removed by scratching, why one may wonder ? When you look closely the surname can be read as “THAPA”.

Mr. Parthapratim Chakravorty also claims the same in his post

Ironically, after Vijay Mallaya fled from his loan, a similar cheque became viral

Wrong Ones –

This cheque is paid by Nirav Modi to congress to spend one of the Congress party. Now we can understand how commission paid to congress to get loans https://t.co/cpkIzbItze — nagaraj shetty (@nrajshetty) February 26, 2018
