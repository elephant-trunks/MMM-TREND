Amid recent allegations of rape against some ruling party leaders, a controversial statement attributed to BJP MP Maneka Gandhi is going viral on the Internet.

According to a social media post in Hindi, the former Union minister said, "Vishwa ki sabse badi party hai BJP.. 2-4 balaatkar kar bhi diye toh buraai kya? (BJP is the world's largest party. What's the harm if some rapes happen?)".

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the statement attributed to Gandhi is misleading. Her actual statement on rape charges against a BJP leader has been represented wrongly.

The viral Facebook post was shared by "Kauser Sayyed" on September 23. Till the filing of this story, the post has already been shared more than 3,100 times. A similar statement attributing it to Gandhi also went viral in April 2018.

With the help of keywords, we came across a news report of Patrika () published on April 13, 2018. According to this report, journalists in UP's Chandauli asked Gandhi whether incidents such as Kathua and Unnao dent the party's image.

To this, the former Union minister replied, "BJP is the world's largest political party with 11 crore members. If 1-2 such cases come up, how can you blame the whole party for it?"

Gandhi's statement can be heard in the YouTube video of V6 News Telugu uploaded on April 13, 2018. An AajTak report says the same thing.

Therefore, it can be concluded that Gandhi's original statement was twisted and misrepresented in the viral post.

AFWA reached out to Gandhi's personal assistant Anand Chaudhary regarding the viral post. He clarified that the post is fake and she has never given such a statement.
