It took his fans by surprise when a few days back Hollywood superstar Tom Hanks confessed that he and his wife Rita Wilson had COVID-19. The couple went into self- isolation thereafter.

However, netizens went into utter shock when a website called "the-daily-star.com" ran a piece of news with the headline, "BREAKING: CORONAVIRUS CLAIMS LIFE OF TOM HANKS".

The website claimed that the "Cast Away" actor has passed away at the age of 63, in Queensland, Australia. It says, "A Queensland Health spokeswoman said the actor passed away late Friday night AEST from complications in relation to Covid-19."

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this to be a hoax. Tom Hanks seems to be doing well as he is still active on social media.

The website "the-daily-star.com" published this news on March 13, 2020. There is a disclaimer at the bottom of the website which says, "This is satire". Other contents of the website also confirm that it is a satirical website.

There is no news about Tom Hanks's demise in any mainstream media. In fact, he is quite active on social media. On March 15, 2020, the actor tweeted thanking "the helpers" and asking people to take care of "each other".

Thanks to the Helpers. Let’s take care of ourselves and each other. Hanx pic.twitter.com/09gCdvzGcO Tom Hanks (@tomhanks) March 15, 2020

He is also quite active on Instagram.

The actor was in Australia for a film shoot when he and his wife were detected with coronavirus. But the news of his death is absolutely false.
