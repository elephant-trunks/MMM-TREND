Truth

The viral post is not true and is not of a police official thrashing a migrant worker. The video is old and is from an incident in 2018. Upon doing reverse image search using key frames, it was found that it is an incident of a cop beating up an auto rickshaw driver in Lucknow. A FIR was filed against the accused constable for the same. Various news publications carried the incident. Times of India and NewsX have the same video and news uploaded on their YouTube channels.

Thus, this was a case where an old unrelated video was shared with a false claim related to the current unrest and issues within the country.

Attached below are the video news reports by Times of India and NewsX.
