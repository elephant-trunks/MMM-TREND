A heartwarming video of a seagull rescue operation by a chopper in United States is viral on social media with claims that it was conducted by the Jain Samaj in Surat.

The video documents a daring act of a rescuer to reach the injured bird. He can be seen resting on a platform like structure created on the stairs of a helicopter that is in flight as he untangles the wings of the bird. The latter was stuck in an overhead wire. A devotional song titled "Rahe bhavna aise meri" has been added as a background score in the viral footage.

The tweet, originally captioned in Hindi, translates to, "A helicopter was called by the Jain Samaj of Surat to rescue a bird stuck in a wire. Live and let live - Mahavir." (Original text in Hindi: "जैन समाज सूरत द्वारा तार में उलझे घायल पंछी को सहायता देने के लिये हेलीकॉप्टर मँगाया गया । "जीओ और जीने दो"—महावीर")
