In the context of Nupur Sharma controversy, photos and videos are becoming viral on social media sites with different claims.

A user named NATHU RAM GODSE The Most Discussed Man shared a picture with the caption, “Qatari Anchor Fatima Shaikh on national TV expressing concern about religious freedom in India”. In this picture, a burqa-clad woman with her head bowed, her hand on her forehead, is seen almost in pity.

Similarly, a user named AdvisorZaidu captioned,”Qatari Anchor Fatima Shaikh on national TV expressing concern about religious freedom in India.”

Fact Check: This picture was found on AP IMAGES after doing reverse search image on the internet. In this TV anchor Khatereh Ahmadi bows her head while wearing a face covering as she reads the news on TOLO NEWS, in Kabul, Afghanistan, Sunday, May 22, 2022.

Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers have begun enforcing an order requiring all female TV news anchors in the country to cover their faces while on-air.

At the same time, we also found tweet from the official Twitter handle of Tolo News, according to which the Islamic Emirate in a new order has demanded all female presenters working in TV channels to cover their faces while presenting the program.

Conclusion:

It is clear from this fact check of DFRAC that the claim being made by the users is fake, because the image on which this claim is being made is not from Qatar but from Afghanistan.
