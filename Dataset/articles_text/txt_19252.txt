BOOM found that the image is photoshopped and is a composite of two separate images. On running a reverse image search on the photo, we found a similar looking picture of Hemisha Thakkar, a municipal councilor in Vadodara, Gujarat. Priyanka Chaturvedi's face has been superimposed on the body of Thakkar. BOOM had previously debunked the photo when it was being shared in April 2019.
