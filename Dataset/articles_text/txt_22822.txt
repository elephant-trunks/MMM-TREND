After Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani’s death in July 2016, his close aide Zakir Musa became the face of militancy in Kashmir. On May 23, Musa was gunned down in an encounter with security forces, and his funeral was attended by many people in the Valley.

Many Facebook users have since taken to the social media platform, posting an image of a gathering of thousands of people, and claiming it to be from Musa’s funeral.
