Fact Check:

In fact, a reverse image search followed by a keyword search on Google revealed that this video was uploaded here on April 7, 2018 by Life in Saudi Arabia channel on Facebook. The caption of the post read: “Baloot Championship begins in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia…”Baloot”, which is similar to French Balote, is a popular card game among Gulf youth, especially Saudis”.

Therefore, this claim is misleading.
