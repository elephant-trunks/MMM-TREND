Many social media users are sharing an image of a religious structure with a dome that looks like a temple. The image is shared with a claim that it is of a mosque, which was built on the base of a Hindu temple.

The image is shared with a caption: “Stunningly beautiful walls | with an ugly-looking dome | Chittor temple converted into a mosque by Mughals… ”

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did a fact-check, and found the claim to be fake.

On doing a Google Reverse Image, we found the same image was published by Shuttercock with a caption: “Shani Deity Temple at Chittor Fort in Chittorgarh city, Rajasthan, India.”

We found the picture of the front entrance of the temple, which was published by 123rf.com with a caption: “Shani Deity Altar, Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, India.”

Another website Thinking Particle described the temple as “inscription of the pillar near western door of the temple mentions that Velaka, son of Kola — treasurer of Maharana Kumbha, built this temple and dedicated it to Shree Santinatha in 1448, and that it was consecrated by Jina Sagara Suri. The temple, which was later covered by the massive wall built by Banbir, is now kept open.”

Hence, we can ascertain that the viral image is of a temple, and a mosque has not been constructed on it.
