Priyanka Gandhi has been leading the Congress campaign in Uttar Pradesh, where the party is in a relatively weaker position. She has been addressing rallies, conducting door-to-door campaigns and visiting temples as part of her outreach.

One such picture of Priyanka wearing a red saree and ringing a temple bell is circulating on social media with a sarcastic remark. Sharing the picture, netizens say that as soon as election season in UP started, Priyanka also began appearing in her grandmother’s saree.

The caption in Hindi translates to, “Elections in UP are here and grandma’s saree has also come out of the closet. But you’ll only get what is hanging.”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that this picture was taken before the 2009 Lok Sabha election. Priyanka had visited a Durga temple in Amethi, UP, while campaigning for her brother Rahul Gandhi.

Using reverse image search, we found that the same picture went viral during the 2020 Bihar elections as well.

The picture was finally traced back to 2009. It was uploaded on “Flickr” on April 12 that year by a user called “Pressbrief.in”. The caption says, “Priyanka gandhi at durga temple during the election campaign for her brother rahul gandhi in amethi.”

Along with the viral picture, other images of Priyanka Gandhi in the red saree and at the same location can also be seen on “Flickr”.

We also found similar pictures on “Getty Images”. As per the caption, these pictures were taken before the 2009 Lok Sabha election. Priyanka had visited a Durga temple in Amethi, UP, while campaigning for her brother Rahul Gandhi.

There are speculative news reports that Priyanka had worn her grandmother Indira Gandhi’s sarees on various occasions.

But linking a 13-year-old picture with the upcoming UP elections is definitely misleading.
