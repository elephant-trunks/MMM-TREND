Truth:

The photo is from Year 2004, Whenzhou, China where Police presented their strength in a rally, the prisioners held at gunpoint in the photo are hardcore criminals and not corrupt politicians. 11 were executed later.

Getty Image claims – “WENZHOU, CHINA: CHINA OUT Chinese police show of a group of hardcore convicts at a sentencing rally in the east Chinese city of Wenzhou, 07 April 2004, where 11 prisoners were later excuted for various crimes. Amnesty International has called for a moratorium on the death penalty in China, saying the country’s dysfunctional criminal justice system meant many innocent people were being executed, after a senior Chinese legislator suggested China executes at least 10,000 people a year, about five times more than the rest of the world combined.
