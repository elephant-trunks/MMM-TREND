A Facebook user named ‘Prakash Kumar’ shared a post on 8 June 2019. The post has a photograph of few men pointing towards a Temple Board and it has written on it -as translated from Hindi “This pilgrimage is a pious place for the Hindus. Shudra and Muslims are prohibited to enter.” Let us see what the facts are!

FACT CHECK:

When we looked at the photograph in the post, the area is clearly tampered where the word ‘शुद्र’ written in the board. The area behind the word is darker in shade than the rest of the board. This increased our suspicion.

We started our search by using ‘Yandex’ image search. What we got in the search is below:

Upon search, we received a Twitter link. A twitter account user named ‘Squint Nayan’ tweeted dated 14 October 2018. He mentioned in this tweet “Another congress pidi @rajivtango shares Photo-shopped image to divide Hindus on caste lines. It has become pattern now and guess 2 takke ka Fact Checker @zoo_bear ain’t gonna do a shit”

Along with this tweet, he shared 2 comparison photographs. In one of the photograph, the board has ‘इसमें’ written instead of the claimed word ‘शुद्र’ |

This clearly states that the image of the Temple Board has been photo shopped to mislead people.

After this, we searched on ‘Google’ using ‘यह तीर्थ हिन्दुओं का पवित्र स्थल है शुद्र मुसलमान का प्रवेश वर्जित है’ key words. What we got in the search is below:



We found a video on ‘YouTube’, which had a recording of the temple entrance and this board. This video was uploaded on 28 October 2017.

Apart from this, we also received an article posted by ‘Patrika’. This article stated that there is a Daasna Devi temple in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. At the entrance of this Temple, the board states ‘Muslims are not allowed inside the temple’. Daasna Masuri is a heavily Muslim populated city and the Muslim youngsters cause a lot of trouble at the time of the Temple’s rituals. This is why they have put up a board with such clear instructions. To read the entire article, please click on the link given below.

We have given both the photographs below for analysis.

Based on the evidences we can confirm that the photograph is photo shopped to mislead people and create illusion.

FactCrescendo advises its readers to refrain from sharing such misleading and communally biased photographs and do a self-check on the true narrative of such incidents before believing them.
