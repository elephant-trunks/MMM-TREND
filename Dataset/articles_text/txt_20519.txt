The momentum between the Russia-Ukraine war is increasing each hour. Russia launched a full-scale military invasion on Feb 24, 2022. Since then things have escalated between the two countries.

Meanwhile, on Social media sites, we saw certain posts going viral all around the globe.

Certain pictures of the explosion got viral claiming it to be of recent times. So many people took it as an opportunity to praise the brave hearts of Ukraine.

Another Facebook page “ Republic-Times news“ posted the same under the same caption in Hindi .

Fact Check:

By reverse image search we found that the same images on the web platforms like Flicker and gettyimages. Through these platforms, we learned that images getting viral on social media sites in recent times are old images from January from the year 2014.

The reason was Ukrainian anti-government protesters who throw Molotov cocktails during clashes with riot police in central Kiev.

The news was also covered by a newsletter “THE CONVERSATION” giving the details of the protest held in the year 2014.

Conclusion:

Although the images are from keiv, Ukraine but from the protest against the government in the year 2014 and not of Russia-Ukraine war.

Claim Review: Ukrainian citizens destroy 2 Russian tanks with Molotov cocktails in Kiev.

Claimed by: “ Republic-Times news“and others.

Fact Check: misleading.
