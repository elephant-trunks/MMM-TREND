Social media has been one of the major mediums to spread Fake News about the pandemic disease COVID-19. Almost every country has called for a lockdown or has asked their citizens to stay indoors in order to contain the situation. Amidst this, an image is going viral on social media where men and women are clamped to a wooden plank with the claim that people in Thailand are being punished for disobeying the lockdown and stepping out of their houses.

This image is also circulating with the claim that this image is from Nepal where the citizens are being punished in this manner for disobeying the lockdown.
