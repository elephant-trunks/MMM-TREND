Believing it to be true, netizens have been flooding social media with critical comments on Sania.

When we reverse-searched the photo of Sania in hijab, we found the original image in the picture story by Rediff News which dates back to November 9, 2006. She can be seen with her mother.

According to Rediff, this picture was sent by a reader, Suhail Ahmed Sajjad, who claimed that it was taken during Sania's visit for Umrah in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

We also found a news article related to Sania's Mecca visit on local news website ARAB NEWS. The article said Sania was in Saudi Arabia with her family in May 2006.

India Today established that the collage is misleading. The photo of Sania in hijab is not from Pakistan but it is an old photo clicked in Saudi Arabia in 2006.
