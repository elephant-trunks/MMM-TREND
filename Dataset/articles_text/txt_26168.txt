A screengrab of a tweet by the name of National Security Advisor Ajit Doval is getting viral on social media. Further, in the screengrab, it is written that, if there is no Saraswati Pooja in Jamia then why is iftar celebrated in Banaras Hindu University? VC should be asked this question?

Social media users are sharing this screenshot massively on their accounts.

Similarly, another user Dr. Ram Pandey also shared the same screengrab.

Fact Check

To know the reality of the viral screengrab we looked for the official Twitter account of Ajit Doval. But, found a tweet of the verified account of Arindam Bagchi, official Spokesperson, Ministry of External Affairs, India. In the tweet he wrote, “Important Alert! Shri Ajit Kumar Doval K.C., National Security Advisor has no official account on Twitter. This is to advise caution against impostor or fake accounts under his name.”
