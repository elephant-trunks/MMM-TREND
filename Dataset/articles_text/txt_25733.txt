FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the post, and found it to be false.

We extracted the keyframes of the video and put them through a Reverse Image Search. We found similar videos of the same tunnel uploaded by multiple YouTube channels in 2021. The videos can be seen here, here and here.

As per the video, it is the Kuthiran tunnel in Kerala. We also found a video report by The News Minute, dated August 6, 2021, with the title: “Kerala’s Kuthiran tunnel road on Thrissur-Palakkad NH open for traffic”.

The description of the video reads: “The 1.6 km-long tunnel is the first road tunnel in Kerala, and it will also reduce the travel time between Coimbatore and Kochi.”

On searching further, we found similar visuals shared by Union Minister Gadkari on July 31, 2021, with the caption: “We will open one side of the Kuthiran tunnel in Kerala today. This is the first road tunnel in the state and will drastically improve connectivity to Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The 1.6 km-long tunnel is designed through Peechi-Vazahani Wildlife sanctuary.”

Hence, it is clear that the video of the Kuthiran tunnel in Kerala is being shared with a false claim.
