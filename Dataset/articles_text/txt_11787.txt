Amid mosques and monuments like the Taj Mahal and the Qutub Minar being put under cultural and communal scan, a photo showing a structure with a dome on top, is being shared on social media with a claim that a temple was converted into a mosque by the Mughals.

However, the image shows a temple named Sringar Chauri, which is situated within Chittorgarh Fort in Rajasthan.
