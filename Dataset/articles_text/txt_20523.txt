A video is going viral on social media. In which it was claimed that a Muslim woman was thrown from a moving bus by RSS workers for wearing a hijab.

Fact Check:

On checking the viral video, we found that this video is from Bangladesh. This video was published by ‘ATN Bangla News’ channel on 09 March 2021. In which it was told that the woman was pushed for not paying the bus fare.

According to the news channel report, this incident came to the fore in Rohitpur area on Dhaka-Nawabganj road in Keraniganj, Bangladesh. In this case, the accused bus driver and helper were immediately arrested by the team of the local Rapid Action Battalion (RAB).

Conclusion:

Hence the viral video is misleading. Because this incident is not of India but of Bangladesh.

Claim Review: A Muslim woman was thrown from a moving bus for wearing a hijab.
