As former union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia quit the Congress party leaving Kamal Nath's government in Madhya Pradesh in turmoil, a social media post involving his resignation letter has gone viral.

The post showed the screenshot of a tweet, purportedly tweeted by 'BJP Karnatakaa', degrading Scindia by calling him a dog.

India Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the Twitter handle which made this remark is not the official Twitter handle of Karnataka BJP. It is a parody account which was created in April 2019.

Facebook page 'The Positive Indian' shared the screenshot of a tweet by 'BJP Karnatakaa' saying: "On this auspicious occasion of holi, we just bought a new dog #JyotiradityaScindia #MPPoliticalCrisis." And the caption of the post claimed: "Scindia was a leader in Congress, Now he is Dog. Its from official handle of Karnataka BJP."

Scindia tweeted a picture of his resignation letter addressed to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on March 10. We found that the Twitter account 'BJP Karnatakaa' clearly states that it is a parody account.

The handle has an extra alphabet 'a' in Karnataka in the display name. We found that the account was created on April 16, 2019, and has many satirical tweets targeting the BJP and its leaders. Also, it only has around 1,100 followers.

The official handle of 'Karnataka BJP' is a verified handle with a blue tick but has more than 3,68,500 followers.

Hence, it is clear that the Karnataka BJP has not made any such derogatory reference to Jyotiraditya Scindia and that the viral tweet was tweeted from a parody account.
