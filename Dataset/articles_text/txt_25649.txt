On July 18, 2022, former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) won 15 of 20 seats in the by-election held in Punjab — most populous province in Pakistan. Against this backdrop, an image showing Russian President Vladimir Putin watching Imran Khan’s victory is broadly shared on social media.

The image is shared on Facebook with a caption: “Russian President Putin listening to the news of Imran Khan’s victory”

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim, and found it to be FALSE.

Google’s Reverse Image Search directed us to Alamy.com, which carried the original image. The image description reads: “January 26, 2022 — Russia, Moscow Region, Novo-Ogaryovo — Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Novo-Ogaryovo residence during a video conference meeting with Italian business leaders.”

Searching further, we found the original image published by several media outlets reporting the same event. According to one of the articles published on January 26, 2022, “Russian President Vladimir Putin met via video-link with business leaders from leading Italian companies on Wednesday, in spite of the tensions between Moscow and the West over Ukraine and NATO.”

The original image was also published on the official website of Kremlin on January 26, 2022.

The image was tweeted by the Russian Embassy in Italy on January 27, 2022.
