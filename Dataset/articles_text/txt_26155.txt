In the ongoing GyanVapi Masjid controversy, a collage of two pictures is getting the attention of many social media users.

In one picture Nandi is shown and in the other Gyanvapi Masjid can be seen. It is being claimed that the Nandi of Kashi Vishwanath faces the Gyanwapi Masjid.

People are sharing this with lots of aggression on social media.

A Facebook user shared a picture that states, “Nandi always has its face towards the shivling, but Nandi of Kashi Vishwanath Gyanwapi Masjid, the original Vishwanath mandir. Muslims offer namaz in the masjid while the Nandi gazes at the door waiting for his master to appear. Our Bhagwan is there waiting for us.

Similarly, a Twitter user wrote, “This post is so emotional, don’t know how many of you will relate to it. Nandi always has his face towards the Shivling, but Nandi of Kashi Vishwanath faces the Gyanwapi mosque, the original Vishwanath Mandir. Our Lord is there, waiting for us.”

Fact Check:

We at DFRAC found that the Nandi was not from the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi, but was from the Kashi Vishweshar temple in Wai, Maharashtra.

By reverse searching the image of Nandi we found the same image on many photograph agencies like Alamy and Shutterstock.

The collage of picture is getting viral with the fake claim as it is not from Kashi Vishavnath, but Kashi Vishweshar temple in Wai, Maharashtra.
