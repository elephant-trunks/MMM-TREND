India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that this is not a real-life video but an animation created with the help of Digital Combat Simulator (DCS), a free-to-play combat flight simulation game.

The authenticity of the video could be challenged on several grounds such as asymmetry in lighting. But the most obvious hint was when, at 52 seconds, the parachute at the back of the jet disappeared suddenly.

Several people commented that it is an animated video and not a real one.

YouTuber “cptVLK” uploaded the 1-minute-50-second video on October 17, 2020. The title of the video reads, “MiG 29 landing on the dam ;) DCS”. In his replies, he clarified multiple times that it is an animated video created with the help of Digital Combat Simulator (DCS).

DCS is a free-to-play combat flight simulation game developed by Eagle Dynamics and The Fighter Collection. A gamer can create animated videos of aircraft manoeuvring with the help of this simulation game.

Therefore, it is clear that the viral video is an animation and not a real-life video.
