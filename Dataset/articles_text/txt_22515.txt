An aerial footage showing tens of thousands of people on the street is doing the rounds on Facebook with the claim that it is a rally by Muslims in Delhi against the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be untrue. The video is not from Delhi but Iran where thousands of mourners had gathered for the funeral ceremony of former Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in Iraq in a drone strike by the United States.

Facebook user A Rehman Shaik posted the video with the caption, Delhi rally Muslims. NPR Nrc ke. Khilaaf, which till the filing of this story was viewed more than 9,800 times and shared over 1,200 times. The archived version of the post can be seen here.

With the help of InVID tool, we reverse-searched one of the key frames of the viral video and found a report by Los Angeles Times carrying a similar frame of the video.

The article says that the picture is from the southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz, where thousands of mourners attended Soleimani’s funeral ceremony on January 5. The highly-decorated general was killed in Iraq in a US drone strike on January 3.

We also found a YouTube video of The Telegraph showing visuals similar to the viral video shot from different angles. The title of the video reads, Thousands march in grand funeral procession for Iranian General Soleimani.

The viral video also shows Iranian flags in the crowd. This is also evidence that the video is from Iran. And though India is witnessing massive protests against NRC, NPR and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, but this particular video is not from Delhi.
