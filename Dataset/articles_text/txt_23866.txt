The media reports had stated that RBI and the Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India (SPMCIL) have sent two different sample sets featuring watermarks of the three prominent figures to IIT-Delhi Emeritus Professor Dilip T Shahani and the said professor has been asked to choose one set.

However, the RBI has now denied the reports and has clarified that no such proposal is under consideration.
