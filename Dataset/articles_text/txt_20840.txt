Recently, a document has been circulating on social media which claims that the Inspector General of Police in Kashmir has urgently ordered, “ All non-local labourers in your respective jurisdictions be brought to nearest police/CAPF/Army establishments just now. Matter most urgent”.

This order comes amidst the killings of two labourers by terror outfits fairly recently. This update was posted by many including journalist Syed Shahriyar who has a verified twitter account.

Fact-Check:

The news spread like wildfire amongst users on social media who raged against the order. This prompted the official account of Kashmir Police to call out this information as fake.

The IGP denied this claim and said that the document is fake. Therefore, this claim is false.
