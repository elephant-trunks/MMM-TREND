A video of a group of policemen making a burqa-clad woman do sit-ups on the road was circulated on social media with the claim that the woman was punished for pelting stones at the Ram Navami procession on April 10 in Khargone, Madhya Pradesh. One such post can be seen below.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the claim was misleading. This video has been on the internet at least since 2020.

A reverse search of the keyframes of the video led us to the same video shared by several social media users since at least April 2020.

Further reverse searches of the image on Yandex led us to a post on a Facebook page called “Connect Gujarat”.

On April 16, 2020, the Facebook page shared the same video and claimed it was of a woman getting punished for breaking lockdown restrictions in Surat’s Salabatpura.

Taking a cue from this, we searched and found screenshots from the same video carried in a report published by Divya Bhaskar.

As per this report, the video was from April 2020 when the national lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19. The report too said the woman was punished for violating the lockdown rules.

A Surat-based YouTube channel also shared the same video on April 16, 2020.

Stone-pelting took place during a Ram Navami procession in Khargone, Madhya Pradesh, on April 10, leading to communal clashes. Superintendent of Police Siddharth Choudhary was also hit by a bullet during the incident. However, it is clear that the video in circulation is at least two years old and not related to the Khargone violence.
