A press release detailing restrictions imposed on the movement of citizens to curb the spread of the Coronavirus outbreak in Malaysia is being shared with a false claim that it was released by the National Security Council, Prime Minister's Office (PMO) of India.



The 5-page press release reads dated March 18, 2020, states that the government has declared a Restricted Movement Order from March 18, 2020 to March 31, 2020, in view of the coronavirus outbreak.
