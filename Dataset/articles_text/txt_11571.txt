A Facebook page named ‘Nation First’ shared a post on 11 June 2019. The post containd a photograph of AIMIM party leader and MP Asaduddin Owaisi. On the photo, it is written as a claim that Owaisi wrote a letter to the UN stating the Muslims in India are not safe. The answer came from the UN ‘where ever you are safe, go there’. Did Owaisi really write a letter to the UN and get such a reply? Let us see what the facts are!

FACT CHECK:

We first searched the shared claim in the post with the key words ‘owaisi writes letter to un’ on Google. What we got in the search is below:

We did not get any news from this search, which can confirm that Owaisi has written a letter to the UN, but there was some other news related to the UN with his name.

We received a news broadcast by the Hindustan Times dated 16 June 2018, which states that Owaisi dismissed UN’s report in which it stated that there are incidents of human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir. Owaisi had declared his support to the current central government on this matter and had said that the UN has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of India.

The Times of India also broadcast this news on 16 June 2018. The news states that Owaisi had opposed the UN’s Kashmir report on human rights violation by saying that the UN has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of India.

Apart from this, we received another news, which is related to the letter written to the UN. However, Owaisi did not write this letter. Azam Khan, the leader of the Samajwadi Party, wrote it. The news broadcast by ‘India Today‘ on 7 October 2015 stated that in the context of Dadri mob lynching, Azam Khan wrote a letter complaining to the central government, which Owaisi opposed. Owaisi said that this is an internal matter of India, and we should solve it within the country itself.

Apart from this, we also found a post shared by AIMIM on Facebook, in which ‘AltNews’ shared a fact check.

With this information, it is clear that Owaisi never wrote any letter to the UN. Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan wrote the letter to the UN, which the above viral post claims. This also shows that Owaisi is strictly against an outsider or an organisation interfering in the internal affairs of India. Now, since Owasisi never wrote such a letter to the UN, then there is no scope of receiving any answer from the UN, ‘Where ever you are safe, go there’.

IN CONCLUSION:

FactCrescendo advises its readers to refrain from sharing such misleading and communally biased photographs and do a self-check on the true narrative of such incidents before believing them.
