Fact Crescendo found that the video is old and not related to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.

FACT CHECK METHODOLOGY

At first we ran a reverse image search on Yandex after splitting the video into keyframes. We came across this link which proves that badge on the soldiers seen fighting in the video belongs to France. You can see it here.

Following this we ran a combination of keyword and reverse image search and came across this video posted on YouTube by user lopez84420 as AFGHANISTAN LEGION on December 21, 2010 and has no connection with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.

We saw that the viral video has been cropped and horizontally reversed.

Here is a comparison image of the same clipping, reversed in the videos:

We also checked Fact Crescendo’s archives and saw that the same video has been used with a misleading caption during the Panjshir Ambush in Afghanistan as well. Here is the Fact Check:

CONCLUSION

From the above evidence, it is clear that the viral video has been in circulation since 2010 and has been shared with misleading captions even before. It has no connection with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.
