The anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) stir at Delhi's Shaheen Bagh has completed almost two months. During the period, several photos and videos of the agitation emerged on social media.

A photo currently going viral shows people from the Sikh community posing in colourful turbans. A Facebook user Dinesh G Gopalan shared the photograph on Thursday, claiming it to be from Delhi's Shaheen Bagh. Some netizens have also shared the image with similar claims.

India Today's Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim with the photograph to be false. The photo is almost three years old and it is from Punjab's Bathinda.

Many on Twitter too linked the viral photo with the ongoing Shaheen Bagh protest. The photo with the misleading claim has been shared by more than a thousand people on social media.

With the help of reverse search and keywords, we found that a Facebook user Gursewak Singh Bhana posted this picture on May 20, 2017, with a caption in Punjabi.

We found Gursewak's contact number on his Facebook profile. When we reached out to him regarding the viral photo, Gursewak told us that the photo was taken in Bathinda three years ago during 'Dastar' - a turban tying competition. According to Gursewak, he organised this competition in May, 2017, and is also present in the viral photo.

Gursewak also sent us one of his recent photographs.

Therefore, it's clear that the viral image is from Punjab and has nothing to do with the ongoing protest at Shaheen Bagh.

However, a delegation of Sikh farmers from Punjab had joined the protest at Shaheen Bagh on February 5.
