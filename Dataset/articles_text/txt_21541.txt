As farmers’ sons Neeraj Chopra and Ravi Dahiya bagged Olympic medals for India, the hashtag #FarmersShineInOlympics began trending on Twitter along with #FarmersProtest.

Soon after, a Hindi tweet purportedly posted by Olympic gold medallist Neeraj Chopra went viral, which translates to, “There is no point in winning a medal if the farmers of the country are suffering due to atrocities by the government.”

Several netizens are sharing the screenshot of the tweet, claiming that Neeraj has openly come forward in support of the farmers’ protest against the new farm laws.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the Twitter handle “@neeraj_chopra_” from which the viral tweet was posted is impersonating Neeraj Chopra. The Olympian’s actual Twitter handle is “@Neeraj_chopra1”.

Till the time of filing this story, the imposter account “@neeraj_chopra_” had already garnered around 24,000 followers. The archived version of the account can be seen here .

AFWA probe

While going through the tweets addressed to “@neeraj_chopra_”, we found a tweet in which a person pointed out that the account was earlier active with the name “@zara_sharif_”.

On searching for the account “@zara_sharif_”, we found that it does not exist anymore. However, we did find a cached version of the account. As per the bio section, the account belonged to Zara Sharif, a Jamia Millia Islamia student.

When we searched for the handle “@zara_sharif_” on Twitter, it led to several tweets posted from the handle “@neeraj_chopra_”.

We also found that some people addressed “@neeraj_chopra_” as “Zara”.

Twitter ID confirmed connection

Using the social media tool Tweetbeaver, we found that the Twitter ID of “@neeraj_chopra_” is 1339895042933104642. Interestingly, the Twitter ID of “@zara_sharif_” also turned out to be the same.

Twitter ID is a unique numeric ID associated with a Twitter account. A person can change the handle multiple times, but the Twitter ID remains the same.

We did not find any tweet or statement by Neeraj Chopra in which he said there is no point winning a medal if farmers of the country are suffering due to government atrocities. Had he given such a statement, it would’ve certainly been covered by the media.

Thus, it is clear that an imposter account of Neeraj Chopra tweeted an apparent “pro-farmer” post, which many people believed was shared by the Olympian gold medallist himself.
