On November 16,2021 an image of Indira Gandhi went viral on all social media platforms. Users claimed that Indira Gandhi was photographed eating fish and ridiculed her for the same.

The claim was posted hundreds of times over on Facebook and Twitter.

Fact-Check:

Upon performing a simple reverse image search we found that the image was used in an article by The Hindu announcing the death of a veteran photographer named Sridhar Naidu, who frequently photographed Gandhi.

In the article, the image is clearly captioned that the Gandhi was eating corn on a cob and not fish.

The image used by the users looks to be slightly blurred trying to create the illusion of a fish. This claim is fake.
