A message with a false job offer is going around in Whatsapp groups, purportedly in the name of Reliance Jio.

Earn a salary up to Rs 60,000 per month, just by posting SMS, daily for 2 to 3 hours from home- the message says and it leads to a web link https://www.jio-jobs.ga/*

But as soon as you click on the link, it asks the user to register your personal details. To look it credible, the page shows some photographs of people who have already done so and are already earning a handsome income.

If you pass on all the details to register you have to click on the Apply now button. But rather than acknowledging about the submission of the application, strangely it takes you to a blog site. Then the applicant is asked to share the message many more times on Whats App to qualify for registration.

This page also contains Terms and conditions.But a closer look at the language of the Terms and condition shows it talks about some irrelevant, random subjects like bitcoins and home mortgage.

This lookalike fake website in the name of Jio has every potential to dupe a gullible jobseeker. It is not very difficult to find out the difference between the fake Jio website and the genuine website of Jio whose website is Jio.com. A simple search about the Jio.com on domain lookup site who.is will give all the details about the company behind it which can be seen here

But a similar query about the fake website trying to cheat people will show you very little information about the people behind it.

Some time back another fake website which also used the same logo as Jio was doing rounds in social media trying to dupe people by selling them the non existent "Jio Coin".
