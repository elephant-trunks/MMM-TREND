While Sonia Gandhi accused the government of postponing the parliament session for a state election, Arun Jaitley hit back saying the Congress did the same in 2011. Is it true that the parliament session was postponed in 2011? Here is a Fact Check.

[orc]

The Congress President Sonia Gandhi criticized the government for not holding the winter session of parliament when it should be held because of the Gujarat elections, during her address to the Congress Working Committee (CWC). The Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley hit back at the Congress saying that postponement of parliament sessions for an election was also done by the Congress earlier and he referred to the year 2011 when such postponement happened.

When is the Winter Session usually held?

The winter session of parliament is usually held in the months of November & December each year. The only exception to this were the years 2003, 2004, 2008 & 2013 when the session began in December as indicated in the table below.

Government of the Day Year Dates of the Winter Session Number of Days the Parliament was in session NDA 1999 30th November to 23rd December 15 2000 20th November to 22nd December 25 2001 19th November to 21st December 21 2002 18th November to 20th December 23 2003 02nd December to 23rd December & January/February 2004 20 UPA 2004 01st December to 23rd December 17 2005 23rd November to 23rd December 23 2006 22nd November to 19th December 20 2007 15th November to 07th December 17 2008 17th October to 23rd December 16 2009 19th November to 22nd December 24 2010 09th November to 13th December 24 2011 22nd November to 29th December 24 2012 22nd November to 20th December 19 2013 05th December to 18th December & February 2014 24 NDA 2014 24th November to 23rd December 22 2015 26th November to 23rd December 20 2016 16th November to 16th December 21

What happened in the year 2011?

In the year 2011 that was referred to by Arun Jaitley, the winter session began on 22nd November. The only set of elections held in 2011 were general elections to the assembly in the states of Assam, Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu & West Bengal. The elections in all these states were held in the months of April & May of 2011. The second part of the Budget session is usually held during this period. It is true that the the budget session in 2011 was cut short and was restricted to 23 sittings (because of these elections), about 10-12 sittings less than the average number of sittings in the budget session during other years.

Claim Check: Arun Jaitley’s statement that Congress postponed the session in 2011 is FALSE since no elections took place in 2011 during November/December and the winter session was held during the usual time. However, he is RIGHT that the Congress did cut short the budget session in 2011 though they did not postpone it.

Was a Parliament session never postponed for elections?

While it is difficult to say if parliament sessions were postponed because of an election, the winter session of parliament in the years 2003, 2008 & 2013 did not begin in November.

In each of these years, general elections were held in the states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi & Mizoram. And strangely enough, the winter session began only after the last day of polling in each of these years. In the year 2008, the winter session started early in October, but there was a break between 24th October and 09th December probably because of the elections.

The NDA was in power in 2003 while it was the UPA that was ruling in both 2008 & 2013. It does seem that both the parties are guilty of postponing a parliament session for state elections.
