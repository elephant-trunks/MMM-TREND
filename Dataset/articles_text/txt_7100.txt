This post claims that the video shows citizens of Aurangabad celebrating the renaming of their city to Sambhajinagar. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.

Claim: Celebrations of the people of Aurangabad after it was renamed to Shambajinagar by the Government of Maharashtra. Fact: The video is related to the unveiling of the largest statue of Chatrapathi Shivaji Maharaj which happened on 18 February 2022 in Aurangabad. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.

We searched with the screenshots of the video in Yandex reverse image search and found a Twitter post. After translating the content in the post using google translate, we found that it is related to the unveiling of 21 feet tall statue of Chatrapathi Shivaji Maharaj in Aurangabad. The event took place on 18 February 2022.

Searching with the relevant keywords on the internet led us to a video that matched the video from the post. This video was uploaded on a Youtube channel named Dragon Proton on 19 February 2022. The first 7 seconds of the video from the post match with the video on the internet from 1:50 to 1:57 seconds. The rest of the 23-second video has various clips from the video on the internet.

The screenshot from the Youtube video matches the first frame of the video posted on Twitter. Since the video belongs to the statue unveiling ceremony that took place on 18 February 2002, it can be concluded that the video does not belong to the celebrations that erupted in Aurangabad after its name was changed to Shambajinagar. Similar videos and web news articles related to the unveiling of the statue can be found here, here and here.

To sum it up, an old video of the unveiling of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s statue in Aurangabad is being falsely shared as the celebrations of Aurangabad people after their city was renamed Shambajinagar.
