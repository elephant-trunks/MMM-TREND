An image that looks like an aerial image of a fingerprint shaped village surrounded by greenery is being shared on social media. It is being claimed that this a village in Germany.

India Today’s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral photograph is not a real image. It is a digital production of an artist Jacob Eisinger.

Facebook page The Reflection posted the image with the caption: Germany village (Erbil) shaped like a fingerprint

To find the truth we ran a reverse search on the viral image and found that this is not an actual photograph of any village. The image is a digital production of artist Jacob Eisinger. He created this digital art for the cover of MODUS magazine that was published in February 2015. We found the picture used as the cover photo in this magazine.

Some other photographs of this artwork that were posted by the artist himself on Behance, a social media platform owned by Adobe. According to Eisinger: For the February issue of Modus magazine, I was asked to create satellite picture kind of artwork showing a fingerprint shaped city to illustrate the human touch.

We also ran a search for the village "Erbil" in Germany but could not find any such village. However, Erbil is the city in Iraq and is the capital city of the Kurdistan Region.

Hence, it is clear that the claim in the viral post is false. This is not the actual photograph or satellite image rather a digital art made by an artist.
