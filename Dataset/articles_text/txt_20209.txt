Even after four years, Pakistan has not been able to get out of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list, but on June 17, the news published on the Crime Tak website, “Pakistan’s name removed from FATF green list”.

Crime Tak wrote, “Pakistan has been taken out of FATF grey list. The decision to remove Pakistan from the grey list has been taken in the ongoing meeting in Berlin (Germany).”

Fact Check:

On internet search, we found a video of Pakistan’s Union Minister Hina Rabbani Khar on BBC Urdu’s YouTube channel. In this video, she can be heard saying that the FATF has expressed satisfaction over Pakistan’s performance (to curb terror funding) and now begins the process of Pakistan’s exit from the FATF grey list.

During this, we got a report by Dainik Bhaskar, which states that even after four years, Pakistan could not get out of the grey list of FATF. The FATF clearly said that Pakistan still needs to take strict steps to stop terror funding.

At the same time, ‘Hindustan Times’ has also published a report with the headline, “Pakistan won’t be removed from FATF grey list immediately, decision after onsite visit.”

Conclusion:

It is clear from this fact check of DFRAC that the news given by ‘Crime Tak’ is misleading. Because despite great efforts, Pakistan still remains in the grey list of FATF.
