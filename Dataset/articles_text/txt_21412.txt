The video was also uploaded on YouTube on April 16, 2017, with the title: Indian Forces brutally beat up Kashmir Youth only to make them chant “Pakistan Murdabad”.

News websites such as “ScoopWhoop” and “The Indian Express” had reported about the video in 2017. But it was

not clear who shot the video and where it was shot.

The video created controversy on social media, forcing the Army to take note. Defence spokesman Col Rajesh Kalia had said the veracity of the video was being ascertained, according to “The Indian Express” report. “Action will be taken against those found guilty of misconduct,” Col Kalia had added.

Therefore, it is confirmed that though celebrations broke out in parts of India after its defeat to Pakistan in the T20 match, the video in question is at four years old.
