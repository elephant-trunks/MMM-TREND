Fact Check

For our fact check analysis we did keyword research but we didn’t found any such news published by NDTV.

Further, on google reverse image search we found another article of the NDTV. The article had the same image but with the heading Sri Lanka Court Bans Ex-PM Mahinda Rajapaksa, Allies From Leaving Country.

Hence, the article was doctored.

Also, we have found the tweets from verified accounts of @CassilingamG and @Suparna_Singh(works at NDTV).
