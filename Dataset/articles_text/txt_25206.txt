Truth

This is a digitally edited image and is not true. The following observations can be made :

The time stamp on the post shows that the postal stamp was issued back in 2017. Records (https://stamps.slpost.gov.lk/) show that no such stamp has been circulated in the country.

The image also mentions the Ceylon Blue Magpie on the side of the stamp where the name of the supposed featured image is to be entered as per the template followed by Sri Lankan stamps.

There is a noticeable font difference as well.

On a closer look, it can be easily understood that the image has been edited onto the stamp.

The official Facebook page of Anti Fake News, Division of Kerala has also released a statement stating that this viral post is fake.

News organisations like Asianet’s fact checking division along with The Indian Express had debunked the same stating that the post was indeed an edit and is fake.
