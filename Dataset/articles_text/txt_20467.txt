Fact Check:

When we looked into the video closely we found that the flag is more identical to the All-India Muslim League. The only, but important difference is that the Pakistan flag has a white vertical stripe on the left. The flag seen on the car’s bonnet has a completely green background with a crescent and star facing towards the right direction.

Also, in the comment sections, many users were clever enough to spot the difference in both the flags.

Thirdly, the same video went viral in the year 2020 .

Tamil nadu jihadis enter Karnataka in a car with Pakistan flag. Bangalore police stopped, asked them to remove and changed National flag. Why Tamil nadu police not take any action against these Sleeper cells of Pakistan? Who tied their hands? or lake of knowledge? https://t.co/aNTL4Zp5NF — Nandagopal.K.M.
