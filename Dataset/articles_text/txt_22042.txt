The Truth

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim is misleading. This video is from Hyderabad captured in 2016 and is not related to the national flag near the Wagah border. Also, the Tricolour near the Wagah border does not hold any world record.

The archived versions of similar posts can be seen here, here and here.

AFWA Probe

With the help of InVid reverse image search, we found that several netizens have been uploading the viral video on Facebook since 2016 with the claim that it is from Hyderabad.

We also found a similar video with the same music and background uploaded on YouTube on June 2, 2016. The caption to the video reads, "CM KCR Hoists Largest Indian Biggest Flag in Hyderabad".

On further search, we found news reports by News 18 and NDTV. According to the reports, the flag was hoisted on June 2, 2016, on the occasion of Telangana's second formation day by CM K Chandrashekhar Rao at Hyderabad's Sanjeevaiah Park.

As per the report, the flag which measures 108X72 feet was hoisted on a 291 feet tall flag post. It was deemed as India's biggest and largest Tricolor at the time of its hoisting in 2016.

In 2017, however, the Hyderabad flag lost the largest flag tag to a flag hoisted in Punjab. The new largest flag now measured 120 feet in length, 80 feet in breadth, and was hoisted on a 360-foot-tall pole at Attari, near Wagah border, in Punjab.

However, it is to be noted that the list of tallest and largest Indian flag keeps on changing with several states trying to break each other's record.

In 2018, beating the record of the Wagah flag, the largest flag in India was hoisted at Belagavi in Karnataka. The flag post was 361 feet high and taller than the Attari flag post by just one foot.

We also found news reports from 2019 about an upcoming 380-feet tall flag post in Meerut's Waleedpur village.

However, we couldn't find any world record in the name of the Wagah flag. After India hoisted a flag at the height of 360 feet at Wagah border, Pakistan also hoisted a flag taller than the Tricolour on Wagah border in 2017.

On September 3, 2020, Factly debunked a similar viral claim.

According to the Guinness World Records, until the time of filing this copy, the world's tallest flagpole is in Jeddah and the largest flag flown is in Sharjah.
