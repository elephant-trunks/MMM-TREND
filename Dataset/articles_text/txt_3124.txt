The unprecedented rainfall has led to severe flooding and waterlogging in several parts of Assam, affecting over 4.5 million people. Against this backdrop, a video showing people movement in neck-deep water is being shared on social media, linking it to the present Assam floods.

The video is shared with a Bengali caption: “এই নদী তই ভাঙিলি আমাৰ ঘৰ…. তোৰ পাৰতে থাকিব আহোতে কৰিলি আমাক পৰ #TnlNews #News #Assam” (English translation: River you destroyed our house. When I came to stay beside you, you made us go away #TnlNews #News #Assam)

Here’s the link to the above post.

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did the fact-check, and found it to be misleading.

On breaking the video into multiple keyframes and doing a Google Reverse Image Search, we found the same video — published in Arabic.EuroNews on September 5, 2019 — with the title: “The hell of the Rohingya Muslims: 125,000 people flee amid official negligence and UN concern”

The Voice of America also shared the video on its YouTube channel on September 5, 2017, with a description: “The UN estimates that over 120,000 minority Rohingya refugees have crossed the border from Myanmar’s northern Rakhine state into Bangladesh in the last two weeks. Myanmar’s de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi says there has been “a huge iceberg of misinformation” about the violence in her country’s Rakhine state. Ankara is pressing Bangladesh to give sanctuary to all Rohingya Muslims fleeing Myanmar. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu is to fly to Dhaka on Wednesday for talks”

Hence, we can ascertain that an old video is widely shared with a misleading claim.
