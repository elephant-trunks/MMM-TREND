Spread the truth:

Tushar Gandhi, great grandson of Mahatma Gandhi tweeted – “As CM of Gujarat he never visited Sabarmati Ashram, not once in 15 years. Now as PM visiting dignitaries drag him there, I guess.”

Let’s divide first sentence in two parts

– As CM of Gujarat he never visited Sabarmati Ashram

– not once in 15 years

Now, both parts are wrong.

Now PM Modi Ji, did visit Sabarmati Ashram accompaning various others ‘as CM’ e.g. Ex PM Manmohan Singh, Ex President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, Ex President Pratibha Patil

All these visits were in last 15 years.

Mr. Tushar Gandhi did try to defend his tweet later but it’s on you to understand the purpose of first tweet which had more than 1000 retweets.

Only because protocol made it compulsory never on 2nd October or 30 Jan as CM. — Tushar (@TusharG) September 14, 2017
