Droupadi Murmu took oath as the 15th President of India on July 25, 2022. In this backdrop, image of a lady sitting on a kitchen floor is being widely shared on social media with a claim that the lady is Droupadi Murmu.

The image is being shared with a caption that reads, “மிகவும் எளிமையா வாழ்ந்த இவரைத்தான்.. #மோடி ஜி ஜனாதிபதியாக்கி இருக்கிறார்…!!! #திரெளபதி_முர்மூ” (English translation, “She lived very simply… Droupadi Murmu ji is made president…”)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did a fact-check and found the claim to be fake.

On closely observing the image, we found no resemblance between the woman in the viral image with President Droupadi Murmu.

On a Google Reverse Image Search, we found that the image was uploaded by a Facebook page, ‘Ama Odisha‘ with a caption: “Kitchen inside President-elect Droupadi Murmu’s home in Uperbeda. (photo courtesy @sheela2010) The difference between the great and the ordinary is simply this: that the great think they are ordinary and the ordinary think they are great.”

We further found that the same image was uploaded by senior journalist Sheela Bhatt on Twitter with a caption which mentioned that the viral image is of Droupadi Murmu’s kitchen. However, it did not mention that it was her.

We further found that a YouTube channel, Shakti TV had uploaded a video on July 21, 2022, with a caption that read, “Draupadi Murmu Home Tour Exclusive : Draupadi Murmu Village.”

We compared the lady in the viral image with the lady in the video and found them to be the same.

Hence we can ascertain that the lady in the viral image is not Draupadi Murmu but the woman who was showing her house to the interviewer. Hence, we can ascertain that the viral claim is fake.
