Australia pulled off a sensational chase to end Pakistan's unbeaten run in the T20 World Cup on Friday. As soon as Aaron Finch and his men reached the finals, fans took to social media to post different claims related to the semifinal match.

Several social media users have posted a video with the claim, “Celebration in Balochistan after Australia's win over Pakistan in T20 World Cup SemiFinal.”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim along with the video is misleading. The video has no connection with the T20 World Cup 2021. It’s an old video and we have found this video on YouTube that was shared in June last year.

Archived versions of posts with similar claims can be seen here and here.

AFWA INVESTIGATION

While investigating the video, we used InVid and reverse search tools and found the same video on YouTube. Eagle Mountain a YouTube channel - posted the video on June 9, 2020.

The caption of the video is written in Arabic that translates to: “Crazy Pakistani Dance”.

But we could not confirm the exact date and location of this video.

Balochistan is resource-rich and the largest province in Pakistan. But a freedom movement is going on in the province for decades and has witnessed several insurgencies against the Pakistan government in the past as locals feel that it is the least developed province in the country.

However, since the video was also in circulation in June 2020, we can safely conclude that this video has no connection with the Australia-Pakistan seminal of the ICC T20 World Cup 2021.
