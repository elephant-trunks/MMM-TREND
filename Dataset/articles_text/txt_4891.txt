Karnataka Hijab Row | There was a report that the national flag was lowered & in place of that a saffron flag was put up but there was no national flag on the poll. Only a saffron flag was hoisted on top of the poll& later they removed it themselves: Shivamogga SP BM Laxmi Prasad pic.twitter.com/3EmS0Wm8C6
