As Phase-1 voting of the UP assembly election 2022 began today, videos of alleged public outrage are making rounds on social media.

One such video of a clashing mob is going viral with a claim that people are thrashing BJP workers during UP elections.

We can see in the video that a large mob has overwhelmed the police who were trying to control the situation.

Users have been sharing this video with the caption – “It seems, assault on BJP is not going to stop.”

Fact Check

The Google reverse image on key-frames of the viral clip led us to the ABP News video on YouTube. According to the news report, the video is from Gorakhpur where BJP and SP party workers clashed with each other on 26 June 2021.

The incident took place during the nomination registration of the Panchayat election. Supports of BJP candidate Sadhana Singh had closed the gate of the District Magistrates office blocking the entry for SP candidate Jitendra Yadav which caused the clashes between the two groups.

According to The Times of India, Samajwadi Party failed to fill the nomination form for the Zilla Panchayat election after clashing with BJP workers as the SP candidate was not allowed to enter the collectorate premise.

On 26 June 2021, ANI UP/Uttarakhand also tweeted about this incident.

CONCLUSION

It is clear that the old video between BJP and SP supporters has been revived with a false claim. The viral video of the clash is from last year’s Gorakhpur Zilla Panchayat election. It is factually wrong to say that the video shows voters thrashing BJP workers during ongoing UP assembly elections.
