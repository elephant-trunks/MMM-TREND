A post, with a motivational statement claiming that Coca-Cola only sold 25 bottles in its first year, is being circulated on social media.

Facebook page "INDIA - Jai Ho!" shared the post with the text: "Whenever you feel bad, just remember that Coca-Cola only sold 25 bottles the first year. Never Give Up!"

India Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the story attached to the viral post is misleading. Coca-Cola was first served in glasses, and not bottles. Also during the first year, the average sale was nine servings per day in Atlanta in the US.

THE TRUTH

According to the website "World of Coca-Cola" the beverage was first prepared by an Atlanta pharmacist -- Dr John S Pemberton -- in the year 1886. The first servings of the drink were not sold in bottles but in glasses at the price of five cents per glass. This website is maintained by The Coca-Cola Company.

As mentioned on the website, "During its first year, sales averaged a modest nine servings per day in Atlanta. Today, daily servings of Coca-Cola beverages are estimated at 1.9 billion globally."

COCA-COLA IN BOTTLE

According to the website "World of Coca-Cola" in 1894, to make the beverage portable, the company started to sell it in bottles. "In 1894, impressed by the growing demand for Coca-Cola and the desire to make the beverage portable, Joseph Biedenharn installed bottling machinery in the rear of his Mississippi soda fountain, becoming the first to put Coca-Cola in bottles. Large scale bottling was made possible just five years later," says Coca-Cola.

It is clear that Coca-Cola didn't sell just 25 bottles in its first year, in fact, it was initially served in glasses only.
