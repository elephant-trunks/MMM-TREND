Reminiscent of the popular saying that a Roman king was playing fiddle while Rome was burning, here’s a social media message that said a video showed a cover version of the song “Endless Love” being sung by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his wife Olena Zelenska. The timing of the video when their capital Kyiv was being bombarded by invading Russian troops has not gone well with many.

See the tweet:

The video shows two singers singing Diana Ross and Lionel Richie’s 1981 famous song “Endless Love” with a cpation that said: “Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and wife Olena sing “My Endless Love” not only for each other but for their beloved conutry Ukraine.” The video is being shared on Twitter here and here and also on Facebook.
