Every once in a few months a recurring claim about Sweden seems to make rounds on social media. This claim suggests that Sweden is soon going to become completely cashless. The government is going to abolish all physical cash and shift the model completely to online transactions.

Fact-Check:

While Sweden has been mostly cashless for quite a few years now. The government has made no official plans to abolish cash based transactions entirely. We went through the government of Sweden’s official website and while the government aims towards eventually making the country cashless, there are no concrete plans to do so.

Therefore, this claim is misleading.
