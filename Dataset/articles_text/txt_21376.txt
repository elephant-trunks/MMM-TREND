Several netizens are sharing a spectacular image that apparently shows a sunset on Earth as viewed from space. Many are also attributing it to NASA.

An Instagram user posted the picture with the caption, "This is what sunset on earth looks like from Space".

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that this is not an actual image of sunset on Earth as viewed from space. Instead, it is a frame of a computer-generated video that shows sunrise on earth from space.

The video was created by a German artist.

Reverse-searching the viral image, we found it in a Reddit post dated September 22, 2021. Commenting below the picture, one user said it is a frame from a CGI video. The user also shared the link to the video which, as per him, is the source of the viral image.

The said link led us to a video posted on "Pond 5", a stock image and video website. The video has been attributed to a German artist with the username "Pixel25". As per the description given here, the video shows sunrise on earth as seen from space.

It is important to note that the actual video is horizontally aligned and has the watermark of "POND5", whereas the viral image is vertical with no watermark.

A NASA spokesperson told "USA Today" that the image is not associated with the space agency.

Alexander Gerst, an astronaut with the European Space Agency, had shared actual pictures of the sunset on Earth as seen from space in 2019. These images can be seen below.

Some time back, an image of artwork had gone viral as the largest astronomical structure discovered so far. AFWA had debunked that claim too.
