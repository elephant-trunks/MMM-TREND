An image showing hundreds of people floating in a river is being widely shared on social media claiming that these are recent visuals from the Guadalupe River in Texas crowded with people in floats.

The image is shared on Facebook with the caption, “Guadalupe River in New Braunfels, Tx this weekend”

Here’s the link to the above post.

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim and found it to be MISLEADING.

A simple Reverse Image Search directed us to a tweet dated June 27, 2017, by Discovering Finland that carried the same viral image. “What kind of activities do you think people can enjoy in Finland? Lots!!” the tweet text reads.

On digging further, we found the same image uploaded on the official website of Kaljakellunta. According to Travel Away, it is a “beer floating festival” that occurs annually in the rivers near Helsinki, Finland. Many similar videos and images from the festival can be seen on Kaljakellunta’s official website.

Thus, it is evident from the above information that an old image from Finland is being falsely shared as hundreds of people floating down the Guadalupe River in Texas. Therefore, the viral claim is misleading.
