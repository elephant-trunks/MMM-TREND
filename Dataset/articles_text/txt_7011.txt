Heavy rains and hailstorm in Delhi on May 30 were a respite to the sweltering heat, but they came at a cost. The historic Jama Masjid suffered damage that included the finial of the main dome getting dislodged.

The incident was widely reported and following it, a photo of a dislodged dome was circulated on social media with the claim that it showed the damaged Jama Masjid dome. One such post can be seen below.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the photo in question is not from Delhi. It was taken in 2017 in Uttar Pradesh.

A reverse search of the viral image led us to several media reports from October 2017 that carried the same photograph. According to a Patrika report from October 21, 2017, the photo showed an old Jama Masjid at Uparkot in UP's Bulandshahr. One of the three domes of the mosque had collapsed during the afternoon prayers, injuring three children and a dozen of adults. One of the children succumbed to injuries on the way to the hospital.

A video report about the incident was published by News18 on October 24, 2017. The photo that is now in circulation is a screenshot from this video report.

Following the damage caused by Monday’s storm in Delhi, the Shahi Imam of the Jama Masjid wrote to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) requesting removal of the dangling part of the crown and repair of the ornamental structure.

In the letter to ASI's Director General V Vidtavathi, Jama Masjid Shahi Imam Syed Ahmed Bukhari mentioned that after being broken into multiple pieces in the storm, some parts fell on the terrace below the main dome, and one very heavy part is "still hanging precariously from the dome and it may fall any time".

It is thus clear that the viral image in question is from a 2017 incident in Uttar Pradesh and is not related to Delhi’s Jama Masjid getting damaged in a storm.
