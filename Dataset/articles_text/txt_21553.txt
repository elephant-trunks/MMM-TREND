Amid renewed spike in Covid-19 cases in the United States, a viral message claims that American President Joe Biden has announced detention of non-vaccinated people in “quarantine camps” till they take their jabs. A screenshot of what appears to be a news item gives out the message.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral message has been taken out of context from a satire article. On the contrary, the US government has not mandated vaccines.

With the help of keyword search, we found that the original article was published on a website called “The Stonk Market” on June 17, 2021.

The headline of the article reads, “President Joe Biden announces Americans not vaccinated before 2022 will be put in camps.”

“President Joe Biden announced his latest effort to stop the spread of COVID-19, he will be putting Americans who have chosen to not be vaccinated, into ‘quarantine camps’ where they will be detained indefinitely until they get their shots,” reads the article.

However, the website clearly declares itself to be a satirical platform. “TheStonkMarket.com is a financial satire site. The site provides unique coverage on the financial industry, stocks, hedge funds, and global markets. Mission: To provide daily humor and make stonks go up” it says at the bottom of the homepage.

Recently, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has proposed mandatory vaccination for health workers and universal masking amid reports of rising Delta variant cases in the country.

As per “The Guardian” experts say vaccine mandates could be a logical step to contain the spread of the virus. But till now, the US administration has not made Covid vaccines mandatory for citizens.

Therefore, the viral claim about Biden’s quarantine policy for unvaccinated people is a work of fiction.
