A post is being circulated on social media that says “if you search up ‘Illuminati’ backwards and add ‘.com’ in the browser, it leads to the official website of the NSA.” Let’s verify the claim made in the post.

Claim: Searching ‘itanimulli.com’ (Illuminati spelled backwards) on the internet leads to NSA’s website. Fact: As stated in the post, searching on the Internet for ‘itanimulli.com’ (Illuminati spelled backwards) does lead to the website of NSA. John Fenley of Provo, Utah, set his unused domain ‘inanimulli.com’ to redirect to NSA’s website just as a joke. Since this has been done by someone as a joke, it is not a conspiracy. Hence, the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.

When we searched on the internet, we found that an internet user named John Fenley has used his domain ‘itanimulli.com’ to redirect it to NSA’s website. In an interview given to ‘Snopes’, he said – “I decided to forward the domain Itanimulli.com domain to the NSA as a joke … kind of like a rickroll + shock site“, and also said, “When I had the idea to forward the domain to the NSA, I couldn’t pass it up and couldn’t stop laughing“. We also found a Quora thread in which Quora users have mentioned John Fenley and his joke. In fact, by doing some simple research on the internet we found that anyone who has a registered domain name can redirect their site to another website.

One can verify this by clicking on this link- itanimulli.com or by searching ‘itanimulli.com’ on your web browser. Multiple free tools on the internet confirm that the redirect has been setup for this domain.

According to the ‘Snopes’ article, such a claim has been in circulation since 2009.

To sum up, searching ‘itanimulli.com’ (Illuminati spelled backwards) on the internet does lead to NSA’s website but it was done by an Internet user as a joke, and is not a conspiracy.
