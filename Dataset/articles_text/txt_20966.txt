The Maharashtra government recently tightened security around the grave of Afzal Khan in the Satara district of Maharashtra following political controversies over Aurangzeb's tomb in Aurangabad and the Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi. Amid this, people shared a post that states: “Court had ordered to demolish the tomb of Afzal Khan at Pratapgad in Maharashtra. But the Maharashtra government still continues to protect it.”

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that this claim was misleading. No court in India ordered the demolition of the tomb of Afzal Khan in Satara.
