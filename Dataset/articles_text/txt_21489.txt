The Taliban has been heavily criticised for its curbs on women’s rights. Be it in education, sports or public life, there have been severe restrictions on women in Afghanistan. So much so that they are not even allowed to move freely or dress according to their will under the new regime.

Amid the global condemnation, a screenshot of a purported CNN article is going viral on social media. The screenshot says that the Taliban has banned the use of sanitary napkins as Sharia law does not allow it.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the screenshot is morphed. CNN has not published any such news, and so far, there have been no credible reports about a ban on sanitary napkins in Afghanistan.

The apparent screenshot shows the mobile view of a purported report posted in the “World” category on the “CNN” website. However, several spelling errors raised doubts regarding its authenticity. For instance, “sanitary” has been misspelled as “sanitory” and “complaint” has been wrongly used instead of “compliant”.

We compared the viral image with an actual screenshot of a CNN report from the “World” category. A simple comparison between the two also reveals that the viral ‘screenshot’ is not genuine. Both the dateline and author by-line are missing in the viral screenshot. The CNN logo in the top left corner is also upside down.

The image of a woman facing a rack of sanitary napkins that has been used along with the viral screenshot has been carried by several Indian news websites over the years.

Also, we could not find any credible media report saying the Taliban has banned the use of sanitary napkins in Afghanistan. Such an act would surely have made headlines.
