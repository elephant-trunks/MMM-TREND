THE TRUTH

India Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the poem has not been penned by Ram Jethmalani but by Rashmi Trivedi.

AFWA searched the internet for the first few lines of the poem and this led us to the Siasat.com website which showed that the poem had been penned by writer Rashmi Trivedi.

AFWA looked for social media accounts of the writer and found that Rashmi Trivedi's official Facebook page had this poem uploaded on December 2, 2017.

In the comment section, Trivedi has thanked people for appreciating the poem and has even said, "I have come across many who blatantly copy and forward under their name."

Therefore, it does seem like it was Trivedi who wrote the poem. AFWA has written to her for a response and the story will be updated once Trivedi reverts.

AFWA spoke to Delhi based writer Rashmi Trivedi who said, "This poem is written by me. It is not for the first time that it has become viral with some other authors name. In 2017 as well, some people had forwarded it on WhatsApp with different names." Trivedi who has written three books until now will soon be releasing the fourth one.
