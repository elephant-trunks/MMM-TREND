A video of a journalist has surfaced on social media, in which he can be seen questioning Union Home Minister Amit Shah: why the Centre did not help financially when there were floods in Telangana.

The video is being shared in the backdrop of Amit Shah’s recent Hyderabad visit for the BJP’s National Executive Meeting.

Facebook users are sharing the video with a caption: “उत्तर भारत के किसी भी पत्रकार के गांव में इतना दम नहीं है कि वो अमित शाह से इस तरह का कड़क सवाल कर दे !…..👇 सीधी बात , नो बकवास #तेलंगाना” (English translation: No journalist of north India has enough courage to ask such a tough question to Amit Shah!…👇 Straight talk, no nonsense #Telangana)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the post, and found that the video is old.

In the above video, we could see the logo of V6. Based on this, we ran a keyword search and scanned through their YouTube channel. We traced a longer version of the video — shared on V6 News Telugu YouTube Channel on November 29, 2020 — with a title: “Amit Shah face-to-face over Hyderabad floods, GHMC Elections 2020 | Exclusive | V6 News.”

The viral clip can be seen at 0:41 seconds. In the video, replying to journalists, Amit Shah said: “We have given maximum amount of money to Hyderabad. But I want to say that houses of seven lakh people were flooded, but where were Owaisi and KCR? Our party workers, ministers and MPs were amongst the people.”

We also found another video with live streaming of Amit Shah’s Road Show. This video clip can be heard at time code 4 hours 15 minutes and 36 seconds.

Thus, it is now clear that the video is quite old and resurfaced recently.
