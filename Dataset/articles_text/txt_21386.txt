A picture circulating on social media shows Rahul Gandhi holding a kid wearing a saffron tshirt with the BJP’s lotus symbol on it. Sharing the image, social media users have taunted the Congress leader with remarks such as, “Confirmed he too must be pressing the button for BJP any doubt?”

India Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the picture to be morphed. In the original image, the kid is not wearing a t-shirt with the BJP symbol.

Using reverse image search, we found that the original picture was tweeted from the official handle of the Indian National Congress on November 3, 2017.
