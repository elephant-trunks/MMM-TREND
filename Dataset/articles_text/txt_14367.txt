Mamata Dubey:I was locked up in washroom at Gandhi Sewa Niketan by the children, when I talked to authorities about it,they said that children can do whatever they want.When I went there after 2 days,I was beaten by the children.I also went to complain to district administration. https://t.co/I67GEVOWPA pic.twitter.com/rFjCjTtFLi
