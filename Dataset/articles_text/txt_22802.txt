Doctors in Kolkata have been on protest over the past few days after two of their colleagues were beaten up by relatives of a patient who died during treatment. Amid the stand-off, many on social media claimed that one of the injured doctors has passed away.

Junior doctor Paribaha Mukhopadhyay and Yash Tekwani are the victims who got beaten up at the NRS medical college, Kolkata and it is claimed that Paribaha Mukhopadhyay has passed away.

The protests later spread across the medical fraternity in West Bengal and gradually, all over the country. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had warned doctors to resume services or face stern action.

A Facebook Page named Renu Pandeya, Samajsevika posted a photo of the doctor and claimed that he has passed away.

India Today’s Anti Fake news War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be completely false.

The post has been widely shared by many social media users. Here is the archived version of the post.

West Bengal Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi went to meet the injured doctor on Friday evening, and later told media persons that he is doing fine.

On June 13th, a Times Now Journalist Mayukh Ranjan Ghosh tweeted a video of Paribaha Mukhopadhyay in which he can be seen talking to someone in the hospital.

All those concerned about the health of the Kolkata doctor,



He is alright and recuperating.

However, the video is two days old but it seems in the video that Paribaha is out of danger and recovering.
