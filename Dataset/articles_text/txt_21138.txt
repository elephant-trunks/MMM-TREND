As the BJP’s victory in UP became apparent on March 10, a short video clip of a bulldozer stunt began making the rounds on Twitter and Facebook with the claim that this was how people were celebrating Yogi Adityanath’s victory.

The caption in Hindi on one such viral post reads, “Long live, Bulldozer Baba. There is no limit to the happiness of bulldozers in UP today.”
