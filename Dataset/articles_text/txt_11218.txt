Fact Check-

We started our investigation by running a keyword search on Youtube to find the recent speech given by PM Modi in Bokakhat in Assam on 21st March 2021. We found that soon after he says, ‘show dreams to the poor, lie to them, make them fight amongst each other and rule’ he adds, ‘this has always been Congress’s formula to stay in power’. The second part has been cropped out to leave out the context in which the statement was made.

One can hear the original statement from 35:20 to 35:30 seconds.

Below you can see the comparison video of the clipped video which is being shared out of context and the original version of the video.

In the original video we can understand that PM Modi said the viral statement referring to Congress rule over the years.

Conclusion- Fact Crescendo found the viral video on social media to be shared out of context. In the original video PM Modi said the viral statement referring to Congress rule over the years. The video has been clipped and shared misleadingly.
