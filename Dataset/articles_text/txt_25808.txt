Following the release of Akshay Kumar-starrer Samrat Prithviraj, a screenshot of the purported ABP News Breaking bulletin has surfaced on the Internet, according to which ‘Delhi High Court had asked the filmmakers of the Samrat Prithviraj to depict Prithviraj Chauhan as a Gurjar King and not a Rajput’.

The text in Hindi reads: “दिल्ली हाई कोर्ट ने कहा फिल्म में राजपूत नही दिखाया जाएगा गुर्जर थे सम्राट पृथ्वीराज चौहान” (English translation: Delhi High Court said Prithviraj Chauhan would not be portrayed as a Rajput, as he was a Gurjar king)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above post, and found it to be FAKE.

We investigated with a keyword search, but could not find any report by ABP News or any other publication supporting the above statement.

We also tracked another report by The New India Express, dated June 2, 2022, which stated that Delhi High Court rejected the plea claiming the king was a Gurjar.

By closely observing the viral screenshot, we noticed that the report in ABP News was quite old.

We also noticed the difference in the font of the text.

On observing the breaking news window on ABP News, we noticed that the font of text in the viral screenshot is different from the text on the channel.

Meanwhile, ABP News took it to Twitter to clarify that the viral screenshot is FAKE.

Hence, in conclusion, the above findings establish that Delhi High Court did not make such a judgement and the viral screenshot of ABP News is digitally manipulated.
