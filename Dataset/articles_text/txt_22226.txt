A black-and-white picture of a woman in a bikini, along with two men, is going viral on social media with the claim that she is current Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

Facebook user “Sanjay Sinha” posted the picture, and without taking Sonia Gandhi’s name, captioned it, “Dekho Congressiyo apni Rajmata ko (Congress workers, look at your queen).”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the picture to be false. The woman in the viral photo is Swiss actress Ursula Andress. It was taken on the sets of “Dr. No”, the first movie in the James Bond series.

The misleading post is being shared on Twitter as well. Some Twitter users have mischievously asked others to identify the woman. The archived version can be seen here.

A simple reverse search revealed the truth behind the photo. Many websites have used this picture and said it was taken on the sets of “Dr. No”.

IMDB had also used the picture in its photo gallery and captioned it, “Sean Connery, Ursula Andress, and Terence Young in Dr. No (1962)”.

Ursula Andress is a Swiss actress who has appeared in American, British and Italian movies. She is best known for her role as “Honey Ryder”, opposite James Bond, in “Dr. No”. In this movie, Sean Connery had played the role of James Bond, the fictional British Secret Service agent.

This is not the first time pictures of Ursula Andress have been passed off as Sonia Gandhi. Multiple scenes from “Dr. No” in which she was seen in a bikini were passed off as Sonia Gandhi earlier. Those were also fact-checked.
