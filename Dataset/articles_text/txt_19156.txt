A set of two graphic images showing a man with whip marks on his back has surfaced with netizens falsely linking it to the farmers' tractor rally which turned violent on January 26.

BOOM found that the images are from 2019, when a father and son duo were brutally thrashed by Delhi police, after a scuffle broke out over parking a vehicle.

The images are doing the rounds with claims that the police inflicted torture on two Sikh men for participating in the tractor rally where thousands of protesting farmers entered Delhi with their tractors on January 26; the protesters eventually diverted to the Red Fort complex. This prompted police to resort to lathicharge and tear gas. A farmer died in the ensuing clash between the protesters and police. Delhi Police has so far detained 200 people in connection to the violence.

One such post in Bangla reads, ''Such torture on father and his son by police is heart breaking during Kisan Rally, today.'' (Original caption in Bangla: আজ কিষান রেলিতে পিতা পুত্রের উপর পুলিশের এই অত্যাচার কিন্তু বুক ফেটে যায়।) Click here to see the post and here for an archived link. Warning: The images are graphic in nature

The image has been viral on Twitter as well. The tweets are archived here, here and here.
