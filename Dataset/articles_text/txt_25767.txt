Students in Bihar were protesting against Central government’s Agnipath recruitment scheme. Many trains were burnt during the protest. Reportedly, protesters burnt around 50 coaches and seven engines.

In the above context, a video is widely being shared on social media showing protesters burning properties at a railway station in Bihar. While some claim it to be of Danapur, many others claim the video is of Muzzafarpur.

A social media user shared the video with the caption: “लोग टूट जाते हैं बैटरी वाला रिक्शा खरीदने में , तुम लोग तरस भी नही खाते हो ट्रैन जलाने में #Agniveer #Agnipath #YOJNA” (English translation, “People break down in buying an e-rickshaw, but you guys don’t even feel sorry for burning the train #Agniveer #Agnipath #YOJNA.”)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did the fact-check, and found it to be misleading.

On closely observing the number plate of the car seen in the viral video, we found it to be starting with ‘GJ’ which is for the state of Gujarat.

We further did a Google Reverse Image Search with the keyframes of the video and found the same video was uploaded by NDTV on June 3, 2022, with a caption: “A huge explosion, followed by fire, occurred at Deepak Nitrite Company in Nandesari GIDC in Vadodara, Gujarat.”

A screenshot of the video was also published by Hindustan Times on June 2, 2022. The article associated with the video reads: “A massive fire broke out after an explosion at Deepak Nitrite Company at Nandesari GIDC in Vadodara. The cause of the explosion is yet to be known. ANI”

Hence, we can ascertain that the viral video is of Gujarat and not Bihar. Thus, the viral claim is misleading.
