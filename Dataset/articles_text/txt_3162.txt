FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above post, and found it to be false.

Using InVid, we extracted keyframes of the video and put them through the Reverse Image Search. Upon multiple searches, we came across a report about a clash between farmers and cops in Rajasthan’s Churu having similar visuals from different angle.

We ran another search with relevant keywords and found one more report by ABP news, dated June 16, 2022. According to the report, farmers have been protesting for over three months, and on Wednesday (June 15, 2022), while police were trying to enter the SDM office, women protesters were thrashed.

On digging further, we came across a Facebook post by a user, Bhumi Birmi, who, according to her bio, is the district president, women wing, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Non-political), Churu. The post, dated June 15, 2022, had the longer version of the video in question.

On scanning through the Bhumi Birmi post, we found many images relating to the farmer’s revolt in Churu.

At the time of filing this report also, there were no news about Nupur Sharma’s arrest.

In conclusion, it is proved that the video in question is not of Nupur Sharma getting arrested. Hence, the viral claim is false.
