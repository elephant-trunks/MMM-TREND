As India took over presidency of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) as a non-permanent member, several social media users claimed it is the first time in history that the country is chairing the all-important UN body.

The archived versions of some of the claims can be seen here, here and here.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. This is India’s eighth term as a non-permanent member of UNSC and it has assumed the rotating presidency in all its terms since 1950.

According to UNSC, apart from its five permanent members (United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia and China), the General Assembly elects 10 non-permanent members from different regions for two-year terms. India was one among the 10 countries elected to the UNSC in June 2020 as a non-permanent member for 2021-22.

Member States elect India to the non-permanent seat of the Security Council for the term 2021-22 with overwhelming support.

Following this, India officially took over the presidency of UNSC on August 2, 2021.

But is this India’s first time as the president of the council? Clearly not.

India in UNSC

A press release issued by the Mission of India to the UN on June 17, 2020, clearly states that this is India’s eighth tenure as a non-permanent member in UNSC.

India’s previous tenures can be seen under the “Members” category in the UNSC website. According to details provided here, India had been elected as a non-permanent member of the UNSC for 1950-51, 1967-68, 1972-73, 1977-78, 1984-85, 1991-92 and 2011-12.

Who can become UNSC chief?

According to details given under the section “Security Council Presidency” on the UNSC website, the presidency of the council is held by each of its members in turn for one month, following the English alphabetical order of the member states’ names.

Accordingly, the presidency of UNSC was passed on from France to India in August 2021, and Ireland will take over the role from India in September. India is set to take over presidency of the council again in December 2022.

A press release by the Permanent Mission of India to the UN, dated August 2, 2021, says that the last time India chaired the Security Council before 2021 was in November 2012.

We found several media reports confirming India has chaired UNSC in all its seven previous tenures, starting 1950.

A 2011 report by “The Hindu” that says India will preside over UNSC in August 2011 and November 2012 can be seen here.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to virtually preside over an open debate on maritime security at the UNSC on August 9.

According to MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi, Modi will be the first Indian PM to chair an open debate at the UNSC.

However, it is clear that India has served as the president of UNSC in all its previous tenures as a non-permanent member since 1950.
