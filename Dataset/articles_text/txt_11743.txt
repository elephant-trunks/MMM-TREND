A photograph of a purported TIME magazine cover, likening Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Adolf Hitler, has gone viral. However, we found that the image was fake and it showed a morphed version of a TIME magazine cover.

Similar images that likened Russian President Vladimir Putin with Hitler had gone viral earlier this year in February amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Quint's WebQoof team had debunked the images of the magazine cover back then.
