Fact check

The picture is of a session conducted by Ukraine defence officials to teach how to hold and use weapons for survival in war. I-stock posted the same picture on 19th February 2022 and mentioned the territorial defence drill given to the people of Kharvik, Ukraine.

Business Insider India has also posted how people are spreading misleading news by using pictures.

Therefore, the claim is misleading as officers were taking drill sessions to civilians and not using them to fight in the war.

Claim Review: People of Ukraine are the cardboard made guns in the war
