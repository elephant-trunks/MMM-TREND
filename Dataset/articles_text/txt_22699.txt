With very little information coming out from Jammu and Kashmir since Article 370 was abrogated, social media is flooded with misinformation and misleading photos claiming to portray the situation in the Valley.

An image of an injured mother-child duo is doing the rounds on social media with the claim that India’s brutality has turned Kashmir into a living hell. The post by Facebook page Kashmirat - on August 22 has been shared more than 900 times till the time of filing this story.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral photograph is not from Kashmir but Gaza. It was clicked way back in December 2008. The archived version of the post can be seen here.

Probe

AFWA ran a reverse search and found the untampered version of the image in the stock of Getty Images.

The caption attached to the image says: Samera Baalusha (34) (R) sits with her surviving daughter Eman (15) and son Mohammad (15 months) while waiting to see the body of her daughter Jawaher Baalusha (aged 4) during the funeral held for her and four of her sisters who were killed in an Israeli missile strike, on December 29, 2008 in the Jebaliya refugee camp, in the northern Gaza Strip.

Conclusion

Therefore, it is clear that the viral photograph has nothing to do with Kashmir, as it is an 11-year-old image from Gaza.
