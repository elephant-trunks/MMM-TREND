Support has poured in for Kangana Ranaut after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation demolished her office in Mumbai following a long spat between the actor and Shiv Sena leaders. From common people to outfits such as Karni Sena and Republican Party of India (A), many have expressed solidarity with the “Tanu Weds Manu” actor.

Social media too now resembles a warzone with supporters and opponents of Kangana hitting out at each other, and related hashtags dominating Twitter since Wednesday. Amid this, a viral message on Facebook says the Ambani family has come forward to help Kangana with Rs 200 crore to build a new studio. The claim attributes the announcement to Nita Ambani.

The caption of the post reads, “To make Kangana a new studio Ambani family will help 200 crores Nita Ambani”.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that no such announcement was made. The Ambani-owned Reliance Industries Limited has denied the claim, calling it fake. The archived versions of the posts can be seen here, here and here. The claim is being widely circulated on Facebook. AFWA found no credible news report that even remotely hints at Nita Ambani recently expressing or announcing her family’s eagerness to help Kangana with Rs 200 crore to build a studio or office. We reached out to Reliance Industries Limited whose officials denied the viral claim and called it “fake”. The officials said no such announcement was made on their part following the Kangana-BMC controversy. Earlier too, the Ambani family was at the receiving end of social media rumours, which have been debunked by several fact-checkers. Some of these articles can be read here, here and here.
