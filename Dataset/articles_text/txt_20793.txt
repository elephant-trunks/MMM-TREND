In the last few weeks, images of temple architecture of India have been circulating online. Users have been celebrating Indian architecture with images of carved exteriors.

The images have been circulating with the same exact caption,” वो हमारी विरासतों का मजाक उड़ा सकते हैं, लेकिन उसके आर्किटेक्चर को मैच नहीं कर सकते (They can make fun of our heritage. But can’t match its architecture) “ Citing the architecture of Chamrajeshwara Mandir in Mysore.

Fact-Check:

We performed a reverse search on the images posted by users and found that the same claim has been in circulation since atleast 2020.

Additionally, we found that the images were posted on Flickr with the title that the these images were infact taken at Nenbutsushu Sampozan Muryojuji Temple in Hyogo, Japan. Nenbutsushu Sampozan Muryojuji Temple in Hyogo, Japan is one of the Buddhist sects that represent Buddhist cultures of China, Korea, and Japan, according to its official website.

There is also a YouTube video available online further confirming that the images have not been taken in India.

Since the images have not been taken in India and are not a representation of Indian architecture, this claim is false.
