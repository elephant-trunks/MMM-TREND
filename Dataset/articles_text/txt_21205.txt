A video of security personnel thrashing Muslim men has gone viral with the claim that the army had caught Muslim spies working for Pakistan in Ajmer.

Several Twitter and Facebook users shared the 15-second-long viral video with a caption in Hindi, that reads, “Army beating Mohammad Yunus, Ahmad Maulana, and Saddam for spying on Ajmer for Pakistan”.

The India Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the clip was from a two-year-old video from Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh. In April 2020 during the Covid-19 national lockdown, police took action against people who violated the curfew and went out to a local Mosque to offer Friday prayers at Unkala Road in Ratlam.

With the help of the InVID tool and reverse image searches, we have found a longer version of the viral video posted on Facebook ( https://www.facebook.com/ watch/?v=255469325847842&_rdr ) in April 2020. According to the person who uploaded it, this video was from Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh, where police took action against people who violated the Covid-19 lockdown.

The same video was posted by a journalist on Twitter around the same time with a similar claim that this was from Ratlam.

Taking this as a clue with the help of keywords search and narrowing down the timeline, we have found several news reports and videos of the same incident published in April 2020 on various mainstream media and social media platforms.

Per the news reports, during the lockdown, a group of Muslim men violated the restrictions and gathered in a local mosque at Unkala Road, Ratlam to offer Friday mass prayers. Local police rushed into the spot and arrested a few people for violating Covid-19 protocol.

Thus, we conclude that the viral claim is false. The video does not show Pakistani spies being thrashed in Ajmer by army jawans.
