A claim is getting viral on social media where people are claiming about how a Christian student was forced to offer Namaz in the prayer. Nitin Singh posted a video of 2 minutes where a supposedly MNS worker of Raj Thackeray took revenge and made Muslim women wear saffron shawls.

Many other users also posted videos and claimed the same.

Fact-check

After cross-checking we found the original video was released by TIMES NOW Navbharat. In the video, we found the original story about how a group of ladies wore saffron shawls and came to theatres for watching The Kashmir Files.

Another proof

News18 also covered the news of how police removed their saffron shawl and gave a legal notice to them.

ANI also tweeted about the news and interviewed a woman who joined a group for watching The Kashmir Files and the group had a uniformity of wearing saffron shawls as a symbol their group.

A woman says, "The women had joined a group that was helping them watch 'The Kashmir Files'. The group had no badge or anything of that sort, so they provided them with saffron stoles for their identification as part of the group. There was nothing else behind it."
