Fact Check

The claim is misleading as users have read the half story of the man in the picture. The man in the picture is a criminal Politician of Uttar Pradesh, Atiq Ahmad. In the article of Hindustan Times , Atiq Ahmad was accused of keeping Lucknow based realtor a hostage. They tortured Mohit Jaiswal (hostage) for several hours in Deoria jail and transferred Jaiswal’s 4 firms worth 45 crore on their names.

The riot in the picture has taken place after 2017 says the article in The Asian Age. The communal clashes took place in many places of Uttar Pradesh including Kanpur. The article got published on 2nd October 2017. Hence proving the article is fake and misleading.
