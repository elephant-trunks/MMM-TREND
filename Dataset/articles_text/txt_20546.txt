FactCheck

After doing a reverse image search, we found a video on YouTube with the caption, “Massive explosion at Ukrainian military ammunition depot.” The video was uploaded on Sep 28, 2017. The video is more than four year old. Therefore, it has nothing to do with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Conclusion

Hence, it is clear that social media users are sharing an old video. Therefore, the viral video is fake and misleading. It has nothing to do with the present situation. The situation in Ukraine is very critical but many people are sharing many false and baseless news. DFRAC, warn the readers not to trust any piece of information without knowing the full reality.
