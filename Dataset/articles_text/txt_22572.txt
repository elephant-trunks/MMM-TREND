There is a national outrage over successive incidents of rape and murder of two women in Hyderabad and Unnao. Amid this, a video has gone viral on social media wherein a man is seen repeatedly slapping a young girl and another girl with a baby in her lap is seen crying.

It is being claimed that the video is from Kalyanpur in Rajasthan.

Facebook user 'Hansraj bagadiya SFI sikar' shared the video along with a post in Hindi which translates to, "If there is some humanity left in your soul then please share it. This video is from Kalyanpur in Rajasthan. Media persons should come forward to find out how this woman is being tortured by her whole family and share this video so that the culprits are punished and there is an end to atrocities against women..."

Here's the post.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the post to be misleading. The video is not from Rajasthan but Santa Catarina in Brazil.

The archived version of the post can be seen here.

AFWA PROBE

AFWA found that the language spoken in the video is Portuguese. Taking this as a clue, we ran a reverse search on one of the key frames in the video with the help of InVID tool. We found an article in Portuguese which shows a still similar to the viral video.

Upon translating the article, we found that it was about a father assaulting his own daughters to take revenge on his former wife. We then searched YouTube and found a video posted by a news channel in Portuguese, the caption of which said, "Police arrest father who humiliated and assaulted his daughters to take revenge on his ex wife."

Portuguese is the official language of Brazil.

As per media reports, the man, identified as Carlos Aimar, was arrested by Santa Catarina Police.
