Election campaigns are the most prominent part of any election. Government introduces many schemes during an election. A viral claim has been driving social media nuts, Bihar Congress a well-known page on twitter has posted a tweet, “महिलाओं के लिए फ्री बस सेवा लाएंगे। महिलाओं को मुफ्त, सुलभ और सुरक्षित बस सेवा मुहैया करवाएंगे।। ये वादे नहीं प्रतिज्ञाएं हैं। #111CongressDubara #Ayegi_Congress

Translation in English: Women will be provided free buses; they will provide free, accessible and safe bus services to women. Nevertheless, these are not promises but pledge

Many more accounts of congress supporters have also posted pictures of the same claim.

Fact Check

The claim is fake and misleading as Congress party have never introduced any such claims rather the CM of Assam, Shri Sarbananda Sonwal brought the scheme of free bus services for women and senior citizen to commute within Guwahati. The official page of Chief Minister of Assam tweeted, “CM Shri @sarbanandsonwal flagged off a fleet of 25 Pink Buses under Bhraman Sarathi scheme in presence of Industry & Transport Minister Shri @cmpatowary in Guwahati. Under this scheme, women & senior citizens can avail free bus services for their commute within Guwahati.”
