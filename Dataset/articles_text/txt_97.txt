As a reminder.. this is what the Ukrainian army did when they entered the land of Chechnya and executed an old man who was reading Surat Al-Fatihah with his wife without mercy and today the verse is reversed and Chechnya enters with the Russian army.. to take revenge on what the Ukrainians did to them …forward so people can see the real truth about Ukrainians
