A picture of BJP MP Manoj Tiwari lying on a hospital bed with his head and neck bandaged is circulating on social media with sarcastic claims indicating that he was beaten up by the public in Delhi.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the picture to be misleading. Tiwari was not heckled. He’d received injuries during a recent demonstration when he fell off a barricade after police used water cannons to disperse protesters.

AFWA probe

Reverse-searching the picture, we found that it was taken on October 12, when Tiwari was admitted at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital. According to media reports, the MP was taken to hospital after he received injuries while protesting in front of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence.

Reports say Tiwari was leading a group of protesters seeking revocation of the Delhi government’s ban on public Chhat Puja celebrations in the Capital.

As Delhi Police used water cannons to disperse protesters, Tiwari, who was standing on a barricade, lost control and fell down. He injured his forehead.

The below “ABP News” report also shows how Tiwari injured himself during the protest.

Soon after the incident, Tiwari himself posted a video on his Twitter handle assuring his supporters that his condition is stable.

To further confirm the viral claim, we got in touch with Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor. “Only BJP workers and police were present at the protest site. Tiwari got injured after he fell off the barricade. No one heckled him, and so, we have not filed any police complaint,” Kapoor told AFWA.

Delhi Police too confirmed that there has been no complaint of Tiwari being heckled. “He was injured during the protest. There’s no complaint that he was heckled by anyone,” Delhi Police PRO Chinmoy Biswal had said.

Hence, it is clear that various social media claims indicating that the Bhojpuri singer-turned-politician was beaten up by the public in Delhi are not true.
