The viral video is not from Mumbai nor from Gujarat. The video is from Oman.

Over the past few days, Mumbai along with other parts of Maharashtra have been receiving extremely heavy rainfall. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has even issued a red alert for the city and its suburbs today.

With rain comes the onslaught of videos showing Indian cities inundated in waist-deep water. Although, some of the viral videos are old and do not show the recent situation in Mumbai.

One such video showing sea waves pulling two women into the water is widely circulating on social media as a scene from Aksa Beach in Malad, Mumbai.

This video is also being shared to be from Gujarat amidst the ongoing Gujarat floods.

Our readers tagged us on social media and forwarded such videos on our WhatsApp FactLine number (9049053770).

The caption of the post says, “Aksa Beach Malad.”

We started our investigation with the help of a keyword search on YouTube, whose results led us to a report by Times of India published on 2 July 2022. The headline of the video states, “Oman: High waves prove deadly at Salalah beach, search for 5 Indians underway.”

According to the report, the viral video is not from India but from Oman. The video shows Salalah Al Mughsail beach in Oman. The strong waves at the beach had swept away 8 Indian citizens who crossed the safety fence at the shore. Three people involved in the accident were rescued. You can read TOI report here.

According to Gulf Today, a family of 8 people fell into the sea after they crossed the fence of Al Mughsayl Beach in Dhofar Governorate, Oman. Three of them were rescued and provided with the necessary first aid by the paramedics before transferring them to the hospital for further medical treatment, while the other five are still missing.

Conclusion-

Fact Crescendo found the claim made along with the viral video to be False. The viral video is not from Mumbai nor from Gujarat. The video is not related to the ongoing floods and monsoon in India. However, it shows a recent incident that took place at Salalah Al Mughsail beach in Oman on July 2022.
