A set of images of an Iraqi photojournalist in tears is being falsely linked to footballer Lionel Messi's exit from FC Barcelona, where he played his entire career. Messi fought back tears on Sunday, August 8, 2021 while addressing a press conference where he confirmed that he is leaving Barcelona after his contract ended in June. Though Messi and Barcelona agreed to a new contract, the Spanish League did not authorise the deal as it meant Barcelona would fall foul of the financial fair play regulations that govern football clubs in Spain. The images have been captioned on facebook as, “You can feel it.”
