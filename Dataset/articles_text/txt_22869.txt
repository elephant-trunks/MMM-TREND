Political posts with misleading narratives are rapidly spreading on social media during election season. Posting an image of a statue fallen on the ground, Facebook user Sachin Maurya claimed that this was the statue of Baba Sahib Ambedkar, which was vandalised by BJP MLA Karni singh.

This was posted on Facebook on April 6, 2019, just few days before the Lok Sabha poll. India Today Anti Fake News War Room ( AFWA) found this to be a misleading claim. This was a one year old incident and nobody in the name of Karni Singh, as BJP MLA was related to this incident.

The Facebook user urged people in Hindi to make his post viral. This post was already shared more than nineteen thousand times on Facebook at the time of writing this article.

Using reverse search on the viral picture we found a news report of March 4, 2018 by news portal Jagran.

According to this report there were four incidents of desecration of Ambedkar statue happened in two days in various locations of Uttar Pradesh, last year. The picture was also among them.

This particular incident happened in Rampur Karkhana police station area of Deoria. There were tension in the area after this incident which was later contained by the local police. Some people were also taken into custody after this incident. An archived version of the report can be viewed here.

We tried to find out if there was any relation of BJP MLA Karni singh with this old incident. We found that "The Quint" and The Lallantop had filed fact check stories on a similar kind of claim where a video of razing an Ambedkar statue went viral.

It also claimed that the statue was razed by one BJP MLA Karni Singh. Both the websites debunked this false claim and failed to find any BJP MLA in the name of Karni singh.

AFWA found that the viral claim related to this one-year-old incident had no relation with any BJP MLA by the name of Karni Singh. Therefore, it is misleading.
