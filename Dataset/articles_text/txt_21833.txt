A set of two pictures showing a woman bleeding from the head and surrounded by policemen has gone viral with the claim that this is the real face of the Narendra Modi government's "Beti Bachao" campaign. A kid can also be seen crying beside the woman.

Several Facebook users have shared the pictures with a caption in Hindi which translates to, "This is Modi government's Beti Bachao. Share it so much that punishment is given."

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. This 2016 picture is from Mainpuri in Uttar Pradesh when the state was under Samajwadi Party rule. The woman and her husband were assaulted when she challenged her molesters.

PM Modi's "Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao" awareness campaign for the welfare of girls was launched in 2015. In 2016, when this incident took place, Samajwadi Party was in power in Uttar Pradesh. It was in March 2017 that the BJP came to power in Uttar Pradesh and Yogi Adityanath became chief minister.

Earlier, the same picture has been falsely used to target Uttar Pradesh police under the Yogi rule which has been debunked by some fact-checkers.
