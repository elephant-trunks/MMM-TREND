The truth

India Today’s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that this is an old video from Thane and has nothing to do with the Dongri incident.

AFWA did a reverse search of the video and found that it was uploaded by a YouTube channel as Bhendi Bazar building collapse in 2017

Another website said it was the Mumbra building collapse of 2016.

AFWA further searched the Internet for any information on the video and found that it was originally carried in various news channels on September 21, 2013. The same video can be seen here

According to reports, a four-storied residential building called Banoo Mansion had collapsed in Thane’s Mumbra area on September 21, 2013. Four people had died in the incident. News about the incident and trial against the accused can be read here.

Conclusion

The dramatic video of the building collapse that is being widely shared on social media as the Dongri building collapse is actually a 2013 video of the Mumbra building collapse.
