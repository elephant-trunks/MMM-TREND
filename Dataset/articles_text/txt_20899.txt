On September 15,2021, an image of Rihanna went viral on Facebook. Rihanna is an acclaimed musician and business woman who has had a lot of success in the American music industry and with her makeup and clothing lines.

The image of Rihanna posted on Facebook shows her with a baby bump along with the caption “Congratulations Rihanna”. The image has been shared over 43,000 times and 13,000 likes.

Fact-Check:

Upon reverse searching the image on google, we found that this image has been doctored to show that Rihanna is pregnant. The original image was posted as early as 2014 when a fashion blog posted this picture of Rihanna going to dinner.

Therefore, this claim is fake.
