Let us end the day with a laugh. The Dumbo #PidiGandhi does not seem to have noticed the signboard when he entered the Deli. On second thought, the moron would not have understood if he had read it! It says, "No credit till Rahul Gandhi becomes PM" – in other words, never! pic.twitter.com/99dwAafWaO — indian (@Humsafar_MBD) October 14, 2018
