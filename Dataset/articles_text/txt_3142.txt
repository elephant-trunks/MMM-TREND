A video of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has gone viral on social media. In the video he says, “लाल बहादुर शास्त्री का मंत्र था जय जवान-जय किसान, इस सरकार का मंत्र है मर जवान-मर किसान.” (English translation, “Lal Bhadur Shastri said Jai Jawan Jai Kisan, This government says, let farmers die, let soldiers die.”) The caption insinuates that the current BJP government is working against the interest of farmers and soldiers.

The video is being shared with a caption that reads, “मोदी जी का मंत्र, मर जवान, मर किसान!” (English translation, “Modiji’s mantra, die soldiers, die farmers.”)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did a fact-check and found the claim to be Misleading.

We searched with appropriate keywords and found a report published by NavBharat Times on March 29, 2014. According to the report, PM Modi accused the then UPA government of giving the slogan of ‘Mar Jawan, Mar Kisan.”

We found the same video was uploaded on Prime Minister Narendra Modi‘s official YouTube channel on March 29, 2014. The video was shared with a caption that read, “Shri Narendra Modi addressing a massive Rally in Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh.”

Hence, we can ascertain that the viral video is old and is being shared with misleading claims.
