A picture of a newborn went viral on social media. It is being claimed through this picture that this newborn who looked like an alien was born to a Muslim and did not die even after giving 50 injections of poison, then was buried by slitting his throat.

Abhay Thakur wrote the caption, “Weird baby born to a Muslim today in village KD near Shamli! Didn’t die even after 50 injection of poison, when was buried after slitting his throat.

Fact Check:

After doing a reverse image search of the viral image on the internet, we found the same image on Aaj Tak website published a report under the headline, “MP: Alien-like baby born in Ratlam! Know the reason”. It has been said in the report that the skin has not developed on the body of the newborn, due to which all the veins of his body are clearly visible. Not only this, due to lack of skin, his eyes, lips etc. are also swollen. At first glance, the child looks like an alien.

At the same time, according to the news published on the website of Nai Duniya, a woman resident of Baravada in MCH on Friday evening gave birth to a baby at 3.45 pm in MCH. Now not fully developed, it is not known whether the baby is a boy or a girl, weighing 2.200 grams. In-charge Dr. Naved Qureshi said that a woman resident of Baravada has given birth to this child. In medical language, such babies are called collodion babies.

Conclusion:

It is clear from this fact check of DFRAC that the newborn is not born in Shamli, but in Ratlam, and whether Hindu or Muslim is not mentioned anywhere. At the same time, it is also clear that this newborn is not an alien or strange but a collodion baby, so what the users are doing is a misleading claim.

Claim: “A strange baby born to a Muslim in Shamli village!”
