Curfew continues in the Valley amid an undercurrent of tension after the Narendra Modi government's decision to revoke Article 370 and Article 35A and bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories (UTs).

Amid a spate of fake claims on social media, a video has gone viral showing police lathicharging a group of people with beards and wearing skull caps and kurta-pyjama. It is being claimed that the police are beating up Kashmiris.

India Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is around four years old and from Bihar. The archived version of the post can be seen here.

The video is being shared on Facebook with a sarcastic caption that translates to, "Prasad distribution has begun in Kashmir."

On closely observing the video, we found a board that says 'Gardanibagh thana' in Hindi at 35 seconds. Gardanibagh police station is in Patna.

We ran an internet search with the keywords "Muslims beaten up in Gardanibagh" and found a news report published in August, 2015.

As per the report, the incident took place when the All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat (AIMMM) and madrasa teachers held a protest at Gardanibagh stadium.

They allegedly tried to go to the CM's house when they were stopped by the police. They were demanding improvement in the conditions of 2,459 madrasas in Bihar.

We also found the video of the incident posted by Mid-Day.

Thus, it is clear that the viral video is four years old and from Bihar. It has nothing to do with Kashmir.
