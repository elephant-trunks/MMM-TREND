A picture of a woman hugging three crying children is going viral on social media with the claim that it is from India. Facebook page "Akshay Reddy AAP" posted the picture along with the caption, "This will remain my permanent memory of what Narendra Modi has done to my country..."

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. This is a six-year-old photo from the Syrian conflict.

Many Facebook users have shared the same photo. The archived version can be seen here.

With the help of reverse image search, we found the picture on the website of Getty Images.

The caption along with the image reads, "A Syrian woman comforts her children after their house in the Sahour nieghbourhood of the northern Syrian city of Aleppo was bombed on May 14, 2014. Once home to some 2.5 million residents and considered Syria's economic powerhouse, Aleppo has been divided between government and opposition control since shortly after fighting there began in mid-2012."

An article in "The Jordan Times" dated May 14, 2014, and a picture gallery in "CBS News" also carry the same picture, with the claim that it is from the Syria conflict.

Incidentally, in India, the capital Delhi recently witnessed massive violence between two communities. Many fake pictures, videos and claims relating them to the riots are being circulated on social media.

But it is clear that the viral picture is not from India but Syria.
