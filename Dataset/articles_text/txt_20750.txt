The reason why they released Omicron ahead of the scheduled release in May of 2022 is because the fear of the Covid19 Scamdemic was waning. So they had to come up with a new terrorist to instill new fear into the population.

Fact Check

After going through the fact check analysis on this viral image, we found out this image to be fake. As per WHO the delta variant of the coronavirus was found as early as Oct 2020 in India. But this picture shows the variant to be found in June 2021.

Likewise, the Epsilon, Zeta and Eta variant were also found in Jan 21, Apr 20 and Sept 20 respectively. The dates mentioned in the image for these variants to be found is wrong.

Therefore, it states that the image that has been viral is nothing but fake and is spread to create hoax and panic in the society.
