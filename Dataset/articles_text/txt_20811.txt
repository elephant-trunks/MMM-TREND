It has been five years since the demonetisation took place on November 8 in India. Now there is talk of demonetisation in the neighboring country of Pakistan. Actually, many pictures of new notes are being viral on social media in Pakistan.

In viral pictures, it is being claimed to introduce new currency of 50, 100, 500 and 1000 rupees. Along with this, it was also claimed that any new currency in Pakistan will now be in plastic notes.

Fact Check:

However, these pictures are fake. The Central Bank of Pakistan categorically denied that new notes have been introduced in the market.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Monday said on Twitter that pictures and videos of the new currency notes circulating on social media are fake and no such proposal is under consideration.

Therefore, this claim is fake.
