On September 15,2021, a video of former CM of Gujarat Vijay Rupani was posted by several users on Twitter and Facebook.

All the users have posted a similar claim that Rupani has started a bhajan singing business after he resigned from the post of Chief Minister.

Fact-Check:

Upon reverse searching the key frames of the video we found that the video is in fact from 2017. VTV News, a Gujarati News channel posted the video along with the caption,” Viral Video of CM Vijay Rupani Chanting Bhajans with Family Members at his house”

Since the video is from 2017 and the fact that it was taken at Rupani’s house ascertains that this claim is false and misleading.
