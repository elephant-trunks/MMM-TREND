A video is getting viral on social media sites. In the video, it can be seen a man wearing a saffron scarf is trying to remove the headscarf of a lady sitting on a two-wheeler. In reaction to this, the lady and the people started thrashing him and push him on the road. People on the internet are claiming that the Sanghi man is trying to remove the headscarf as he thought only Muslim women do that.

A Facebook user writes, “This Sanghi asked a woman to remove cloth covering head, because he thought only Muslim ladies do that. Watch the response from others. Sanghi’s are brainwashed by Media and Govt”.

A Twitter user shared the same video with same caption.

Fact Check:

We reverse searched the video using specific keyframes and found the same video. We found the same video on the news website of Dainik Bhaskar with the headline, “Slaps and punches rained on the manchle, VIDEO:: In Bina, the girl beat up the young man on the middle of the road for molesting people.”

The report also states that the man was thrashed for harassing the girl. None of the news reports mention anything about a headscarf.

Conclusion:

New reports confirms that the accused was beaten because he had passed lewd comments at the woman, and there was no hijab angle involved.

Claim Review: man wearing a saffron scarf is trying to remove the headscarf of a lady sitting on a two-wheeler.
