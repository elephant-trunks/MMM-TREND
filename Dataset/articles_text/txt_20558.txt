Nowadays Home Minister, Amit Shah has been campaigning in Manipur for the upcoming elections. Amit Shah also made promises to bring peace in the state while having a word with Kuki Militants. As militant groups like Kuki Militants demand a different state identity for the Kuki Tribe in the Manipur.

Meanwhile, a video of the Home Minister got viral on social media. In the video, users are claiming that he is heard speaking that PM Narendra Modi sleeps for the whole day. @DrDatta01 posted the video on February 2022. Many others also posted the same short video and captioned with, PM Modi sleeps for 24 hours.

Fact Check

After digging further, we found the entire video of Amit Shah, giving a speech at a public meeting in Chapra, West Bengal. In the original video, Home Minister said, Modi Ji, thinks about the welfare of the poor/needy people. The Hindi word ‘Sochte’ which means to think was replaced by ‘Sote hai’ (to sleep) in the viral video. Thus people mislead his actual words. The original video was posted on BJP’s official YouTube Page, 10 months ago.

Exactly after 5 minutes 39 seconds, you can listen to him speaking, ‘Modi ji 24/7 think about the progress of deprived ones whereas Didi only thinks of making her niece as the Prime Minister.

Hence proving that the video is misleading.
