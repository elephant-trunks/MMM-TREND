COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a huge amount of false and misleading information on social media forums. Fact Crescendo has previously debunked many such claims on misleading cures, vaccines, home remedies etc. One such post is going viral on the internet these days, which claims that according to the World Health Organization (W.H.O), not a single vegetarian person in the world has died from Coronavirus.

According to the viral post, “The W.H.O reported that not a single person from the world’s vegetarian population has died from Corona. Hearing this news, one is ecstatic and feels proud of the amazing Sanatan Dharma culture.”

Fact Check-

We started our investigation by running a keyword search on the World Health Organization website, but we did not find any reports there confirming that no vegetarian in the world has died of coronavirus. After that, we also searched for related news articles on Google but we could not find any news articles related to this topic.

Next, Fact Crescendo contacted Dr. Roderico H. Ofrin, India’s representative for World Health Organization, via e-mail, and in response, he told us, “The World Health Organization has not issued any such report in this regard.”





Upon further investigation, we came to know that, according to the World Health Organization, 1,448,896 people have died as of 29 November due to coronavirus.



Conclusion- Fact Crescendo has found that the above-mentioned post is False. The World Health Organization (W.H.O) has not issued any such report that mentions that no vegetarian has died due to COVID-19.
