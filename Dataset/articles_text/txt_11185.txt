The same video is being widely shared on Facebook garnering millions of views and thousands of shares.

FACT CHECK

We searched for news about the “death of 650 Jews” but could not get any credible report.

Then we looked for the veracity of the video. After a few keyword searches, we came across similar videos uploaded on YouTube.

It became clear that the viral video of the explosion is not from Israel.

According to Telegraph UK, the video is from Egypt. A ruptured crude oil pipeline set off a huge fire on a desert road in Egypt, says the description.

The Sun and VOA News reported on the same video.

The incident occurred in Cairo on 14 July 2020.

According to Reuters, the fire broke out after an oil leak from the Shuqair-Mostorod pipeline located next to a busy highway in a Cairo suburb. A spark caused by passing cars ignited the crude oil that was leaking from the pipe. 17 people were injured at the time.

CONCLUSION

Hence, an old video in Egypt is being passed off as a recent explosion in Israel. The claim of “650 Jews killed in Israel” is false.
