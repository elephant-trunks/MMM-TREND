Truth

This photo is 6 years old, not from the current ongoing farmers’ protest.

All the police officers in the image can been not wearing masks, hence, the image appeared to be skeptical. Reverse Image search done to find out the credibility of the image led us to a 2015 article by Tribune India and Hindustan Times, about the brawl between farmers and police officials over panchayat land in Patiala.
