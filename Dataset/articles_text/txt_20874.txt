On October 3,2021, a video of an Air India aircraft started to viral on all social media platforms. In the video, a aircraft can be seen under a foot-over bridge on a main road.

Many claimed that this happened as an accident and that the aircraft landed there and got stuck.

Fact-Check

We performed a keyword check and found news reports on the incident. Air India issued a statement to clarify that no mishap had taken place. The aircraft in the video was sold by the company as scrap. As is visible in the video, the wings of the plane have been removed and only the plane was being sold as scrap.

Since no accident had taken place and the aircraft was merely being transported, this claim is misleading.
