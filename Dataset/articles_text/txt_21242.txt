Multiple Facebook and Twitter users shared the video with the caption in Hindi that translates to, “The condition of BJP is pathetic. Another BJP leader was welcomed in Uttar Pradesh with kicks and punches.”

With the help of the InVid tool and reverse image search we have found the truth behind the viral video. A similar video of the attack on the BJP leaders was uploaded on the YouTube channel of ABP News with the title “Attack on BJP President Dilip Ghosh in Darjeeling “. A similar video of the incident was also uploaded on another YouTube channel called NMF News. Both these videos were uploaded on October 6, 2017.

According to these news clips, the now-BJP national vice president along with a few others were heckled by locals in Darjeeling. The incident was reported by The Indian Express on October 6, 2017.

As per this report, after the withdrawal of the indefinite strike called by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) on the issue of Gorkhaland, a Bengal BJP delegation led by Dilip Ghosh, the former state president of the party, visited Darjeeling. As per the news report, Ghosh was chased and heckled, allegedly by supporters of Binay Tamang in Darjeeling.

As per news reports, a couple of weeks ago during the Uttar Pradesh election campaign, BJP MLA Vikram Singh Saini was chased away by people in his constituency in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh.

But the viral video in question is a five-year-old one from Darjeeling, West Bengal, and has no link to the UP election.
