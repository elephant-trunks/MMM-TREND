Fact Check:

To investigate the viral video we used the InVid tool and converted the video into different keyframes. After doing the google reverse image search of each keyframe, we have found a video on YouTube. The YouTube channel of Bharatiya Janata Party had uploaded the video on 13 August 2014. Furthermore, in the video, the then BJP MP from Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh) Yogi Aditya Nath gave a complete speech in the Lok Sabha on the issue of communal violence.

In this video of the speech which was posted on YouTube, at 10:24 minutes, a woman of the opposition party interrupts Yogi’s speech. Then, he demanded her to sit and said that her allegations are baseless. However, Asaduddin Owaisi was not seen creating any kind of disturbance throughout the speech.

Therefore, it is clear that the viral video is edited. So, the video is deceptive.
