A heartwarming photo showing a young child protecting another kid has gone viral on social media. It is being claimed that the photo is from Kashmir where the young boy is protecting his sister during firing.

India Today Anti Fake News (AFWA) found the claim to be misleading. The photograph is at least four years old and is actually from Syria.

A Facebook user Ayan Saif shared this misleading post on September 25, 2019. Though some social media users pointed out that the photo is from Syria.

With the help of reverse search, we found the viral photo in an article of Daily Asian Age, which was published in June 2016. As per the article, this photo is of a Syrian child protecting his little sister during the civil war in Syria.

A twitter user Mohamed TOUBACHE-TER had also posted this picture in 2015, and claimed it to be from Syria. This confirms that the photo is at least four years old.

We also found the original post that had first uploaded the viral photo. The caption in the original post reads The most heart touching picture. A kid protects his sister during firing in Syria. While comparing it with the viral post, it can be clearly seen that the word Syria’ in the post has been replaced with Kashmir’ digitally.
