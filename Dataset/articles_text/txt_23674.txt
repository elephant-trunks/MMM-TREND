By March 2017, India had achieved 53% of its wind energy targets for 2022 with 32.3 gigawatt (GW) capacity installed.

India’s renewable energy target is 175 GW of installed power capacity by 2022 including 100 GW solar, 60 GW wind, 10 GW bioenergy and 5 GW small hydro projects.

In 2016-2017, India added 5.5 GW new wind capacity, exceeding the 4 GW annual target.

The pace of addition was supported by policies including updated guidelines for the development of wind power projects and the introduction of competitive tariff bidding in wind energy auctions, according to this analysis by the World Resources Institute, a global not-for profit.

India has the fourth largest wind capacity in the world after China, the United States and Germany.
