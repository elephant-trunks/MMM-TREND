Uttar Pradesh is going for a month-long assembly election from the 10th of February 2022, polling for 403 seats would be done in seven phases. In 2017, BJP with its allies got a landslide majority of 312 seats. In a highly surcharged political atmosphere stakes of BJP and Samajwadi Party-led collisions are high. With Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party is also trying to regain its lost ground in the state.

All Political formations including BJP which is facing anti-incumbency are making tall claims to win as many seats. The incumbent CM of UP Yogi is now more active on Twitter and trying to build a narrative by tweets. He is tweeting very frequently the political content as well as making claims of his government’s achievement. We have scanned and analyzed various tweets of Yogi Adityanath and fact-checked the claims.

Fact Checks on The Tweets Of CM Yogi

Claim no.1

Election campaigns bring out the best possible promises which can be made by a politician. Providing employment comes under the vital necessity for any party. According to this claim of Yogi Adityanath, before 2017 the unemployment rate was 17.6%. But, after 2017 the unemployment rate slides down to 3.0%.

वर्ष 2017 के बाद यूपी के इतिहास में प्रदेश की बेरोजगारी दर सबसे कम हुई… फर्क साफ है! pic.twitter.com/CuB1wUBcxF — Yogi Adityanath (मोदी का परिवार) (@myogiadityanath) February 3, 2022

Let’s dig into the claim, first of all in the governance of BSP or Akhilesh Yadav in February 2017 the employment rate was also 3.0 %, and coming back to the Yogi government, indeed the employment rate of January 2022 is 3.0 % but it does not include the whole graph. According to CMIE, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy in April 2020 and March 2020, unemployment was at a peak of 21.5% and 20.5 % respectively in Uttar Pradesh. The tweet is quite misleading. As all the political parties have their ups and downs, if you see the graph.

Conclusion the tweet is misleading as both governments have their ups and downs.

Claim 2

In 2017 after winning the election Yogi Adityanath promised to give 70 Lakh jobs in UP. CM Yogi stressed generating the job opportunity through vocational education and skill development in the upcoming 5 years.

UP CM added that our government will provide 70 lakh jobs to the population where 1 crore people are unemployed.

Alas! Reality came out to be brutal, as per the data only 4.5% Lakh Jobs was given by the Yogi govt in the tenure of 5 years claimed by BJP MP Harish Diwedi.

Conclusion the tweet is misleading as only 4.5 lakhs job has been provided in UP.

Claim no. 3

The CM Yogi at his completion of 2 years as a Chief Minister on 3rd January 2019, remarked that no riot has taken place under his governance in Uttar Pradesh.

मार्च में मेरे शासनकाल के दो वर्ष पूरे होंगे। मेरे अब तक के शासन में, कोई दंगा नहीं हुआ है। — Yogi Adityanath (मोदी का परिवार) (@myogiadityanath) January 3, 2019

FACT CHECK

An article of Business standard tells us about the burning cases of UP riots. In comparison from 2017 to 2020, UP has witnessed the fastest fall in riot cases but having said that UP’s falling statistics are more than the number of current riot cases present in any state of India.

If you look at the data closely Rioting cases in Uttar Pradesh is on the third number after Bihar and Maharashtra in 2018 among all other states in India as per the National Crime Records Bureau. Keeping the point in my mind that UP holds a population of 23 crores but according to CM, no riot took place in UP after his governance.

According to our next data in 2019, the crime rate of Uttar Pradesh is the highest among all the states of India which is 13% whereas all other states lie on or under 10% including Bihar.

Last but the most important one, in the comparison between the crime rate cases from 2016 to 2018 the criminal cases have doubled in the District like Kanpur, Gaziabad, and Lucknow.

Conclusion: Hence proving a misleading claim is made about no riot taking place in UP by CM Yogi Adityanath’s Twitter account

Claim 4

CM Yogi, on 8th January 2022, in the tweet mentioned that the party distributed sports essential kits to 25000 members of Mahila dal including women and youth in Lucknow and this is a step taken to empower the Mahila Mandal.

आज लखनऊ में युवक एवं महिला मंगल दलों को खेल-सामग्री वितरित की गई है। यह प्रोत्साहन खेल-सामग्री, प्रदेश में लगभग 25,000 युवक एवं महिला मंगल दलों को उपल​ब्ध कराई जा रही है। युवा कल्याण विभाग तथा दलों से जुड़े युवकों व महिलाओं को हृदय से बधाई! — Yogi Adityanath (मोदी का परिवार) (@myogiadityanath) January 8, 2022

Fact Check

Media coverage of the report: Hindustan Newspaper

134 members of the Youth and Mahila Dal have been given the sports incentive kits in Lucknow. 81 members of Yuva Mahila Dal and 83 to Mahila Mandal Dal. A program was organized by the Youth Welfare Department at the Youth Center near Sai Mandir where MLC (Member of Legislative Council) handed over incentive kits to the members of Yuvak Mangal Dal and Mahila Mangal Dal.

Conclusion: the claim is misleading and fake.

Claim 5

Yogi Ji determined the development in ‘Har Ghar Nal Yojna’. PM Narendra Modi had introduced this scheme in November 2020. This scheme comes under the Jal Jeevan Mission, launched in two districts of Uttar Pradesh Mirzapur and Sonbhadra. Yogi Ji claimed that under the surveillance of Har Ghar Nal Yojna, pure water is supplied to 30k Gram Panchayat villages.

Fact Check

The spin in the story comes here as per the SARKARIYOJNA.COM, the scheme only prevails in 2 districts of UP, Mirzapur has 1971 villages and Sonbhadra has 1450 villages which make a lump sum of 3500 villages. Then how come this scheme has served the people of 30k villages.

Another proof where Police Result posted about Har Ghar Nal Yojna, as you can see the article was posted on 29th December 2021. They have specifically mentioned that the scheme has been launched in only two districts of Uttar Pradesh, Mirzapur, and Sonbhadra.

Conclusion- Serving 30k villages is a fake and misleading tweet done by UP CM Yogi Adityanath. As the scheme, Har Ghar Nal Yojna only serves 2 districts of Uttar Pradesh.

Claim 6

In the tweet of 3 February 2022, CM Yogi posted a clip of a press conference held in Lucknow. Yogi was talking about UP’s growth in terms of vaccination and GDP rate. According to him in the period of 5 years (2017-2022), UP has made a place on the second number or the second largest contributor in the country’s economy. At exactly 10:57 to 11:20 minutes of the video, UP CM claims that due to pandemic states got affected still UP made it to the second position which has not been seen from 1947 to 2017. From 1947 to 2017, UP stood at 6th or 7th position after being the most populous state in the country.

Fact Check

Yogi Adityanath’s statement does not match with data, to be honest. As per the report of RBI, in the list of Gross State Domestic Product Uttar Pradesh was also at 2nd number and Maharashtra at 1st under the governance of CM Mayawati in the (FY 2009-10) UP.

In the year 2017-18, there was a down as UP was ranked to 4th position after Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu as per the tableau of RBI. Under the governance of Yogi Adityanath.

Conclusion: The claim is misleading and fake as in the data of FY 17-18, UP stood at 3rd position after Tamil Nadu. Hence proving that before 2017 also UP made it into the top 3 in the list. And, after 2017 the governance of Yogi Adityanath never came on the second position in the GSDP list.
