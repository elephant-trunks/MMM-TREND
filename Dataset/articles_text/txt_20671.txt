Photoshop has fastened the source of fake news by editing content. A picture of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal got viral, where he is sitting with Bhagwant Mann (who is the party’s Punjab unit chief) outside a liquor shop. The image is going viral and getting nasty comments on it.

Fact Check

The image is fake as Delhi CM Kejriwal and Bhagwant Mann Singh paid a visit to farmers in Chamkaur Sahib. The Tribune has covered the visit and it says that “In a short video of the meeting released by the party on Friday, Kejriwal and Mann are seen sitting on a cot placed in the mustard fields and interacting with some farmers”

Hence proving the viral image is fake and misleading.
