Screengrabs from an adult comedy film on YouTube have surfaced with claims that they show Uttar Pradesh's chief minister Yogi Adityanath molesting a woman.

Three screengrabs from the skit, which revolves around a fraudster hermit and how he sexually harasses his female followers in the name of treating them, are viral, along with an image of Yogi Adityanath. One such post takes a dig at the UP CM's character based on the screengrabs. The post reads, "He wears saffron clothes and chants Ram. But when he sees a woman he is titillated." (Original text in Bangla: গায়ে গেরুয়া পোষাক , মুখে রাম আর নারী, দেখলেই অন্তরে জাগে, কাম ছিঃ ছিঃ। )

Fact Check BOOM cropped one of the screengrabs and ran a reverse image. We were directed to an sleazy web drama titled Baba Ne Khol Diya Nada on YouTube. The drama revolves around a corrupt hermit, who lures women to sexually exploit them in the name of curing them of diseases. He is eventually called out by a woman for his malpractices. The video has been uploaded by several subscribers and is present on YouTube from as early as 2017.
