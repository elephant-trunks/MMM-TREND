Amid the 21-day nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19, several videos and images have surfaced on social media showing policemen thrashing civilians to force them inside.

Now, some photos are circulating on the Internet showing a man thrashing a cop on the road. It is being claimed that this is the result of police atrocities on people during the lockdown. Users are also requesting policemen to understand the helplessness of citizens.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the viral post to be misleading. The photos are three years old and have nothing to do with the coronavirus lockdown.

Among others, Facebook user "Devendra Shukla Amethi" shared the misleading post, which has been further shared more than 350 times till the filing of this story..

Using reverse search, we found that the viral pictures were used in a "Daily Mail" article in June 2017. The report says these pictures were taken when an angry mob rioted and attacked police officers after a teenage schoolgirl was allegedly raped in a hospital in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh.

We also found these pictures in a report by "The Sun" with the same information.

Therefore, it's clear that three-year-old pictures are being passed off on social media as scuffle between police and civilians during the ongoing lockdown.
