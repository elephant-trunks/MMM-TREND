Truth

This video has nothing to do with the election results and victory of PM Modi or even India.

This was uploaded on YouTube on 15th May 2019 i.e. a week before the Election results were announced

The video is by an artist TheGod Joe Kush who make such music videos showering money in the air.

You can see the same event, but from different angle and closer look

There are two man who are throwing the money into the air and both are wearing clothes which looks like what Hip Hop artists or Rappers wear. Both are dark skinned which most of the rapper and hip hop artists are (Eminem is a brilliant exception though)

Photos from the same event

They did the same at Times Square also in the evening, i.e. after Diamond Market
