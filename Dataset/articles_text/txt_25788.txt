A video is being shared on social media, claiming that it shows Hindus protesting in support of Nupur Sharma.

The video is shared with the caption: “नुपुर शर्मा के समर्थन में उतरे जम्मू के हिंदू। अब विश्व देखेगा हिंदू की एकता और ताकत” (English translation: “Hindus of Jammu came out in support of Nupur Sharma. Now the world will see the unity and strength of Hindus”)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did the fact-check, and found it to be delusive.

On doing a Google Reverse Image Search, we found the same video was uploaded by a YouTube channel on April 17, 2022, with a caption: “Delhi Jahangirpuri today news|Bajrang Dal Delhi Jahangirpuri today|bajrang Dal WhatsApp status Delhi.”

Taking a hint, we searched with appropriate keywords and found a similar video was uploaded by the Facebook page of Vishwa Hindu Parishad on April 19, 2022, mentioning that the video was of a procession during Hanuman Jayanti in Noida.

We also found a report by NavBharat Times saying that a procession was taken out by Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal in Noida during Hanuman Jayanti.

While there are reports of Hindus taking out a procession in support of Nupur Sharma, the viral video is old and not associated with it.

Hence, we can ascertain that the viral claim is misleading.
