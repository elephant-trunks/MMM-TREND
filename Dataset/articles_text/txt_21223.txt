In this exclusive interview, former US Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor analyses the high-stakes diplomatic meetings involving Donald Trump’s envoys Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff in Moscow and Berlin. Speaking to the host, Ambassador Taylor discusses reports that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is willing to 'withdraw their request for membership of NATO for the time being' in exchange for alternative security guarantees. He explains the concept of a European-led 'coalition of the willing' to secure Ukraine, distinct from NATO. Taylor also assesses the crumbling of the post-Cold War security architecture and the necessity for Europe to fend for itself against Russian aggression.
