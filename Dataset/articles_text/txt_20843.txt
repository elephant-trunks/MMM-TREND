Amidst the rising violence in Bangladesh, many videos are being shared online that have been linked to the violence. One such video is being vigorously shared online linked to violence in Rangpur.

The video was first shared by the verified account of Bangladesh Hindu Unity Council claiming that Hindu temples and houses were being burnt in Rangpur.

The video has received over 2,60,000 views on Twitter alone and more on Facebook.

Fact-Check:

However, upon performing reverse image searches, we found several local news media coverage of a fire that took place in Karatichhara, Tripura.

The fire actually did take place on October 13,2021 from a suspected short circuit. There was was no communal angle to this.

Therefore, this claim is fake.
