Story behind the picture

Using reverse image search, we found that the picture has been used several times over the past few months with different claims.

Digging further, we found that the picture was published by local news websites in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) in 2019.

According to these websites, the little girl was Lubna from Yakkaghund tehsil of Mohmand tribal district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Lubna was bitten by a snake after which she was shifted to the local Shabqadar hospital for treatment. But the anti-snake venom injection was not available there and the hospital staff asked the girl's family to take her to Peshawar. Lubna had died on the way to Peshawar.

The girl's father complained that lack of facilities in the hospital killed her. He had also alleged that they were given an ambulance without oxygen kit due to which the kid died on the way to Peshawar.

The tragic incident shook Pakistan and soon #JusticeForLubna started trending

in the country. As per news reports from Pakistan, the government sprang into action and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa health department suspended four doctors.

Though there have been reports of killings and torture by the Taliban, this particular image is not related to the ongoing developments in Afghanistan.
