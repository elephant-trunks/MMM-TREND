Several social media users are sharing a video clip with the claim that Muslims shouted communal slogans in Jodhpur after the Congress party's victory in the recently held Rajasthan Assembly polls. The clip in circulation is from Sudarshan News.

India Today Fact Check found the claim to be misleading as the video has been already available on the internet since December 2017. It means that the video went viral a year before the results of the Assembly polls.

In the one-minute-40-second video, people brandishing swords in their hands can be heard saying, "Hindustan main rehna hai toh Allah Hu akbar kehna hoga."

The headline of the story reads: "Rajasthan ke Jodhpur main Bharat virodhi naare."

When we searched on the internet the keywords in Hindi, "Rajasthan ke Jodhpur main Bharat virodhi naare sudarshan news", we found a video on YouTube uploaded by user Manohar Singh on December 15, 2017.

Incidentally, Singh is also a correspondent with Sudarshan News.

Speaking to India Today, Singh said, "I received this video from a source in December 2017, a week after Barawafat festival. I was told that this incident occurred near clock tower."

Singh admitted that neither did he shoot the video nor was he present on the spot when this incident happened.

It is also surprising to see that this incident has not been reported by any other news organisation.

We could only find a news article published by Dainik Bhaskar on December 21, 2017, that a complaint has been submitted by Shiv Sena district president Sampat Poonia against unknown people for raising anti-national slogans on the basis of the viral video.

The Sudarshan News clip has certainly nothing to do with the victory of Congress party in Rajasthan. There is also a doubt about the authenticity of the video.

In the past too, several videos, not related to the recent Assembly elections, were linked with the Congress party's victory.
