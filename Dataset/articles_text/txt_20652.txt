Republic day is on the verge and the major attraction of the day is the parade. Different states of India come to present their tableaus which define the beauty of the individual state. A fake poster is getting viral on different social media platforms. On the name of Karti Chidambaram, Member of Parliament for Sivaganga in the Lok Sabha a poster is getting viral that states DMK government has avoided the information of Tamil Nadu’s decorative vehicle got rejected as the statue of Karunanidhi and his consort Rasathiammal was placed in the vehicle sent on behalf of the Tamil Nadu government in the Republic Day decorative vehicle.

In short– Chidambaram says that the Tableaus which is carrying M. Karunanidhi (former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu) got rejected from the state for the showcase of Republic day celebration.

Translation of the Image

Users are on circulating the poster with a caption of “Karti Chidambaram’s advice to Tamil Nadu government”.

Fact check

After doing the reverse research we got a tweet from a verified account, Niranjan Kumar (Delhi-based Journalist) we got an original picture of Tamil Nadu’s Tableaus which does not include M. Karunanidhi in the vehicle. Additionally Telegraph Online has posted the picture of Tamil Nadu’s Tableaus which has the man in yellow Kurta and not M. Karunanidhi. Users have edited the picture of a man in a yellow kurta to M. Karunanidhi hence spreading the fake news.

Conclusion: The claim of having a statue of M. Karunanidhi in Tamil Nadu’s tableaus is fake and the image is photoshopped as the tableau embedded only freedom fighters of Tamil Nadu.
