Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in November last year launched the 'Ladki hoon, lad sakti hoon' (I'm a girl, I can fight) campaign, focusing on women and women empowerment in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh.

Now, a video showing a group of girls beating a young man with sticks is being circulated on social media with the claim that it shows girls inspired by Priyanka Gandhi's 'Ladki hoon, lad sakti hoon' campaign. In the clip, the girls, who have their heads covered, are apparently thrashing a man who misbehaved with them.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading. While the video is indeed from Uttar Pradesh, it is over three years old.

With the help of keyword search, we found the same video carried by a Times of India report on December 10, 2018. The title of the video reads, "Watch: Girl students thrash eve-teaser inside school premises in UP's Baghpat."

On further search, we also found multiple media reports on the incident. According to these reports, the video is from Dharm Singh Saraswati Balika Inter College in Uttar Pradesh's Baghpat. As per the TOI report, three girls along with their teacher thrashed a man with sticks inside the campus after no action was taken by the school authorities against the man in spite of repeated complaints. The man who fled the spot was later arrested.

The same video in question was also carried by India Today and The Quint in their reports on this 2018 incident.

Congress had launched the party's 100-day action plan for the "Adhi Abadi", an outreach program for women voters in Uttar Pradesh in November 2021. As a part of this, a marathon event under 'Ladki hoon, lad sakti hoon' was also held in Lucknow on December 28.

However, it is evidently clear that the video in question is years old and cannot be connected to the recent Congress campaign.
