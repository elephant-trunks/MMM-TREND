Spread the truth:

A viral post on social media shows a swarm of dead bodies being captured and allegedly stating that countries with large number of COVID-19 cases are euthanising elderly patients. The image is as follows:

The post was initially shared on April 19th and have garnered about 1.9k shares on the online platform. However, this post has since been deleted. The archived post can be found here. A screenshot of the same is as follows:

The write-up on the post is a mixture of Tagalog, an Austronesian language spoken as a first language by a quarter of the population of the Philippines and English. The post has since then been shared on other profiles.

When roughly translated, it paraphrases into appreciating their country’s attempts to take care of their citizens while other countries are turning to horrifying methods to control the COVID-19 spread among the citizens. It then talks about why its important for the people to step up and help their government to maintain by social distancing. The post here carries a translation of the entire text.

Truth

The claim is false and the image has been placed out of context. The picture depicts a scene from the hit AMC series, The Walking Dead. A simple reverse search shows that the scene is from the 9th episode of season 5. It is therefore not an image of countries euthanizing their elderly patients.
