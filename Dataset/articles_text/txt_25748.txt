Unprecedented rainfall has led to severe flooding and waterlogging in several parts of Assam, affecting over 4.5 million people. Against this backdrop, a video is being shared on social media showing some people as controlling a crocodile on a submerged road in a residential area, and claiming that it is from Assam.

The caption reads: “ অসমৰ বানপানীত এইবাৰ ঘৰিয়ালো (কুম্ভীর) ওলাইছে… Assam Floods#Copy” (English translation: In Assam flood this time Ghiyalo (crocodile) has come out. Assam Floods #Copy)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above post, and found it to be misleading.

With the help of the InVID tool, we extracted the keyframes. On putting the keyframe through the Google Reverse Image Search, we found the same video on YouTube, uploaded by DeshGujaratHD, on August 31, 2019, claiming that a stray crocodile was captured during the Vadodara flood.

Further, with the help of the keyword ‘crocodile found Vadodara’ on YouTube, we found another video by NDTV, on August 3, 2019, claiming that a crocodile was rescued from the flooded streets in Gujarat.

Another news report was uploaded by TOI, dated August 4, 2019, claiming that the terror of crocodiles continued in Vadodara due to waterlogging.

On digging further, we also found a news article in Deccan Chronicle, dated August 2, 2019, claiming that crocodiles were found hunting dogs in flooded Vadodara.

Earlier, NewsMobile debunked the same claim when it was being shared in the name of Bihar, Hyderabad and Pakistan.

Hence, the video of a stray crocodile found in the floodwater is from Vadodara in Gujarat, and NOT from Assam.
