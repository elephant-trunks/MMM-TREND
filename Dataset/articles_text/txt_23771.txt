At the end of a year since Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office, the telecommunications ministry put out a series of tweets, putting forward its achievements. Here are three problems we found with the claims. We emailed our findings to the ministry last week, requesting comment. There was no response.: National tele-density increased fastest (4.3%) over 11 months to reach 79.9%. Subscriber base in rural areas rose 4.5% over the past 11 months to reach 48.9%.: Between 2008 and 2012, overall tele-density increased from 26.2% to 78.7%. The compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for this four-year period is 31.6%, according to tele-density data from Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). The average year-on-year increase in percentage-points terms, for the same duration 2008-2013, is 13%. Therefore, terming a 4.2% increase during 2014-15 (or a CAGR of 5.6%) as “fastest” is factually incorrect. Similarly, rural tele-density grew at a year-on-year rate of around 7.5% between 2008 and 2012 in average percentage-points terms. The CAGR of rural tele-density for the four years is 42.7%. During 2014-15, rural tele-density grew in percentage-points terms by 4.4% (or a CAGR of 10%)."font-family: arial; font-size: 12px; margin-left:25px;text-align: justify;">: Our calculations have been done for the financial year, while the government has done them for 11 months.: An "unprecedented" 52% growth in broadband subscribers in 10 months.: The increase in broadband subscribers between 2014 and 2015 is around 63% (and not 52%). The increase is primarily driven by more than 80% growth in wireless broadband. The increase in wireline broadband subscribers is 4.4%.

Wireless broadband subscription increased during 2014-15 primarily because of more than 90% growth in the subscription base of private players like Bharti, Idea and Vodafone put together. State-owned BSNL registered around 30% growth in wireless broadband.

: Our calculations have been done for the financial year, while the government has done them for 10 months.: BSNL and MTNL added 4.7 million and 0.2 million subscribers respectively during 2014-15.: In both landline and wireless categories, BSNL’s subscription base declined by more than 2 million and 17 million, respectively during 2014-15, according to TRAI data . During the same time-period, MTNL registered a moderated increase of subscription base; around 0.02 million in landline and 0.14 million in wireless category. The claim is factually incorrect. ■
