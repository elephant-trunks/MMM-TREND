Spread the truth:

Did Wang Yi, China’s foreign minister resign out of fear of us, our country ?

Well so called Paid Indian Media (pun intended) might have hidden the news but even entire World or for that matter not even Chinese media doesn’t know about his resignation.

Why, you may ask ? Cause there was none.

This photo is viral on WhatsApp and people being moronic as usual, and prove their patriotism are forwarding it making it viral.



This is the actual photo from where Mr. Santosh Shrivastav, the fake news maker picked it.
