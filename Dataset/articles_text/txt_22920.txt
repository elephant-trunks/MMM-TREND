When India was awaiting for the release of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman from Pakistan, multiple social media users began sharing a video of a few uniformed men dancing.

The videos claimed, "#Abhinandan dancing with the Army and Air Force in Pakistan. Soldiers Converted Battle Ground into Love for Each Other" as one Facebook user put it.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the claim was totally wrong. This is an old video and Wing Commander Abhinandan does not feature in it.

Facebook and YouTube users widely shared a video which claimed "#Abhinandan dancing with the Army and Air Force in Pakistan. Soldiers Converted Battle Ground into Love for Each Other." This one particular post was uploaded by "JK News Telecast" and the post was shared by 172 people within couple of hours. This post can be seen here

Many You tube users too shared this video. One Youtube post can be seen here

and this was viewed by at least 9592 users till the filing of this story. Similarly with another post here

that was viewed by 44 people.

These posts had different music compared to other posts but visuals and the claims were the same.

Indian Air Force pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan's MiG 21 had apparently shot down Pakistan's F-16 fighter jet before being hit by the debris. Wing Commander Abhinandan had to eject out of his plane and was arrested by the Pakistani forces.

This happened on February 27. But we found that there are videos of this dancing uniformed men existed on the internet even before the day.

One such link can be found here.

This particular video was uploaded on February 23.

Moreover, a close look at the dancing uniformed men reveals that Wing Commander Abhinandan was nowhere present in the group. Also, the badge on the uniform of the man in question is not that of Indian Air Force.
