A video of a man on a helicopter rescuing a bird tangled in a power line is viral on social media. The video is being shared with the claim that this daring act was performed by a soldier of the Indian Army.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading. This is a 2013 video from Virginia, United States.

With the help of keyword search, we found the same video and screenshots from it carried by multiple media reports in 2013.

A longer version of the video that shows the entire rescue process can be seen below. The video was uploaded by the verified YouTube channel of “WAVY TV 10” on September 19, 2013.

Reports say the video is from Virginia, United States, and the incident took place in September 2013.

According to reports, the video shows a seagull that was stuck in power lines for 24 hours near Lesner Bridge in Virginia Beach being rescued. The operation was carried out by Virginia Dominion Power, an American power and energy company.

After the rescue, the bird was taken to the Virginia Beach Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for treatment and recuperation.

Quoting a member from the Virginia Beach Society, “The Mirror” said that after surgery in one of its wings, the bird was recovering and was being pampered in the way seagulls love “with plenty of junk food”.

We also found a video report by “WAVY TV 10” made before the bird was rescued, in which Dominion Power spokesperson Bonita Harris explains how it could be freed using a helicopter. And this is exactly what we see in the viral video.

“What we have to do is send a helicopter with special equipment. It actually has a platform attached to its side and one of our linemen will have to get on the platform and physically reach over to remove the bird from the line,” Bonita says in the video.

Hence, it is clear that the viral video is almost a decade old and not related to India or the Indian Army.
