A simple reverse-image search directed us to a Twitter post of the spokesperson of BSP’s Telangana unit that carried the original image. In the image, men can be seen hoisting the BSP flag. This was retweeted by many supporters of the party, including BSP Telangana state coordinator R.S. Praveen Kumar.

The English-translated version of the tweet is: “Do not work with devices when the will is great. Our brothers and sisters climbed the ladder and hoisted the blue flag at the heartbeat of masses. Millions of such youths are following in the footsteps of @RSPraveenSwaero for the establishment of a Bahujan Rajya Sabha in Telangana”
