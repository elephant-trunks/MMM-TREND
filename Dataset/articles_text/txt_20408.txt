Cases of Communal clashes are often heard in the news. After Karauli’s violence, an argument between JNU students and ABVP members taking out non-veg from the menu came into the row. Another video is getting viral by pointing out a particular religion on the internet.

अयाचक posted a small clipping of 15 seconds and claimed that a Muslim teacher was seen carrying a gun and roaming around the street in Mainpuri.

Other users also spread the video and claimed that the teacher was caught by the police and used #Muslimterrorist.

Fact check

After doing a google reverse image search, we found the video in the article of Jsnewstimes. Through the report, we got to know her name is Kashmira Yadav and she resides in Firozabad. Therefore, the news about her being Muslim is fake.

Another proof

News24 also posted the viral video and in the caption, they nowhere mentioned that the girl/teacher was Muslim.

Conclusion: the claim is misleading

Claim review: a Muslim woman was caught with a pistol on the street in Mainpuri

Claim by: अयाचक
