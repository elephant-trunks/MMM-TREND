A collage of two photos of former Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been going viral with the claim that Uddhav installed a framed photo of Bal Thackeray, the flag of Shiv Sena, and an idol of Chhatrapati Shivaji in his study only after the political crisis involving turncoat MLAs began in the state.

The first image in the collage shows the ex-CM during Facebook live. Only the Indian flag is visible in the background. In the second image, the aforementioned three items are also visible.

Uddhav Thackeray on June 29 stepped down as CM after the Supreme Court ordered the MVA government to take a floor test to prove its majority in the Assembly. Eknath Shinde, who led the band of turncoat MLAs, was sworn in as CM on June 30.

AFWA found that while the first image is from a 2021 Facebook live, the ex-CM has gone Facebook live with Bal Thackeray’s photograph in the background since January 2022 at least.

AFWA PROBE

We searched the official Facebook page of CMO Maharashtra and found that the first image in the collage was taken from a live video uploaded on February 21, 2021.

We also found other videos of Uddhav with the same background uploaded in April 2021. Meanwhile, the second image in the collage is from a live video uploaded on the CMO Maharashtra page on June 22.

However, while scanning the page, we noticed that multiple live videos of Uddhav from at least January 2022 had Bal Thackeray’s framed photo in the background.

One such video uploaded on January 25 can be seen below.

We also found live videos of the ex-CM prior to 2022 with the idol of Shivaji and the Shiv Sena flag in the background.

It is hence clear that the claim that Uddhav placed a photograph of Bal Thackeray in his study following the political crisis triggered by Shinde’s rebellion is misleading.
