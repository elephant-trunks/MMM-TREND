A video is widely shared on social media, in which a muddy river is seen raging. The viral video claims that the scene is of Balochistan after eight dams burst.

The video is shared with a caption: “State of emergency has been imposed in Balochistan after eight dams burst. Heavy floods have killed 77, and more rains are expected in the next few days”

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did the fact-check, and found it to be misleading.

On doing a Google Reverse Image Search with one of the screenshots, we found the same video uploaded by a Facebook page, Arabian Daily, on July 7, 2022. It was shared with a caption: “Jabal Shams overflows following heavy rain this morning!”

Another YouTube channel also posted the same video, claiming heavy rain at Jabal Shams in Oman.

AlBayan News also tweeted the video on July 7, 2022, with a caption in English: “Overwhelmed by a rain storm in Oman Sultanate”

We found reports of over 160 people killed and several injured this month as flash floods triggered by torrential rains wreaked havoc in Pakistan.

Hence, we can ascertain that the viral claim is misleading.
