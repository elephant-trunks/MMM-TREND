An old hoax has been revived on social media falsely claiming that all communication on WhatsApp including WhatsApp calls (voice and video calls) and messages are being monitored by the government.

Some variations of the WhatsApp forward go on to falsely claim that WhatsApp has added a new feature - 'three ticks' which shown on a message would mean the government has read a user's message.

The post when translated from Hindi reads, ".. 01. All calls will be recorded. 02. All call recordings will be saved. 03. WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and all social media will be monitored. 04. Tell those who do not know. 05. Your devices will be connected to the ministry system. 06. Be careful not to send wrong message to anyone. 07. Tell your children, brothers, relatives, friends, acquaintances that you must take care of them and rarely run social sites..."

The viral message goes on to claim that if there are three blue ticks, it means that the Government has read your messages and found it to be okay. But if you get two blue ticks and a red tick it means that the Government has read the message and the Police will arrest you soon.

WhatsApp's website gives a detailed description as to how many ticks the app shows and what each one indicates. Additionally, it does not mention any feature introduced by the messaging platform on a 'three tick sign'.
