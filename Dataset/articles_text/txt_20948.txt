On September 6,2021 , a page by the name of Rising Pakistan posted a picture on twitter that showed a field filled with military vehicles. The image was captioned “From Panjshir, all the wealth has been captured for the UAE” implying that the Taliban has taken control of the equipment after taking over the region.

The image was subsequently posted on Twitter and Facebook . Gaining thousands of likes and hundreds of comments.

Fact-Check:

Upon reverse searching the image on google we found that the image was first posted by the US Dep artment of Defense in 2013 . The image has been captioned,”Rows of heavy vehicles fill a retrograde yard before shipment on Camp Warrior, Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan, Oct. 2, 2013.”

Therefore this claim is false.
