A post by the official Twitter handle of the Samajwadi party media cell is getting viral on social media. In the tweet, they compared the situation of Uttar Pradesh before 2017 and after 2017. Further, the Samajwadi Party Media cell explains the difference with the help of two pictures. The first picture is of a corporate office in which employees are working in a good environment. SP media cell is claiming that this was the situation of Uttar Pradesh before 2017. As a matter of fact, before 2017, SP was the ruling state party in UP. So this picture may be considered to glorify the SP rule. But, the second picture that is after 2017, shows the terrible condition of UP by showing Lathi charging by police on common people.

Fact Check

On our Fact Check analysis, our team tried to find the source of these two pictures. The first picture is not of Uttar Pradesh but is of Mumbai.

The above picture is of Mofirst Solutions Pvt. office in Mumbai where software developers are working to develop an application.

Also, the second picture is of Lucknow Uttar Pradesh.

वादा था 2 करोड़ रोजगार का, मगर UP में 68,500 सहायक शिक्षकों की भर्ती सही से कराए जाने की माँग कर रहे युवाओं के साथ योगी सरकार का बर्ताव देखिए। जो बच्चों का भविष्य बनाते हैं उनके भविष्य पर ऐसी मार? कांग्रेस उत्तर प्रदेश के शिक्षक अभ्यर्थियों के साथ है। युवा इसका जल्द जवाब देंगे। pic.twitter.com/NSWpF7Agu5 — Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) November 3, 2018

From the above tweet of Rahul Gandhi dated, Nov 3 , 2018.The third picture is the same picture which the Samajwadi party media cell posted. This is the snap of protest in Uttar Pradesh demanding proper recruitment of 68,500 assistant teachers in UP.

Hence, The claim done by Samajwadi Party media cell is fake and misleading.
