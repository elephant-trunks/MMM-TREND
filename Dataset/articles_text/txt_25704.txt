FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the post, and found it to be misleading.

Running a keyword search, we found a report by NDTV, dated February 23, 2019. The title of the video reads: On Pulwama, PM Modi’s Dare for Imran Khan, “Son of a Pathan”.

In the viral video, he is referring to former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan. It can be seen at 1:26 minutes of the report.



We also found the original video on YouTube channel of the Bharatiya Janata Party. It was streamed live on February 23, 2019, when he was addressing a public meeting in Tonk, Rajasthan.

In the original video, it can be heard at 59:45 minutes. PM Modi can be heard saying that when Imran Khan came to power in Pakistan, as per protocol he called and congratulated him. During the conversation, Imran khan said that he is the son of a Pathan.

Referring to Imran Khan, Modi had said: “And he [Imran Khan] told me one more thing, that, ‘Modi Ji, I am the child of a Pathan. I speak truth, and work with honesty’.”

Thus, it is clear that a viral clip has been taken out of context and is being shared with misleading claims.
