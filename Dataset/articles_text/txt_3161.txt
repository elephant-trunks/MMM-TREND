Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced the ‘Agnipath’ scheme on June 14, 2022. According to this scheme, youngsters willing to join the forces will be appointed on a contractual basis for a period of four years. The announcement of the scheme has triggered massive protests across the country.

In the above context, an image is being widely shared on social media with a claim that two brothers, who were aspiring to join the Army, committed suicide post the announcement of the ‘Agnipath’ scheme.

The text embedded with the image reads, “सहारनपुर में दोनो सगे भाई आर्मी में फिट थे एक साथ दी जान MODI H TO MUMKIN H.” (English translation, “In Saharanpur, both brothers were fit for the army, gave life together MODI H TO MUMKIN H.”)
