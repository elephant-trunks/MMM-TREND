Janata Dal (United) leader Ajay Alok is the latest to fall for the age-old hoax that Unesco has declared 'Jana Gana Mana' as the best national anthem in the world.

On Saturday, he made a tweet in Hindi which translates to, "Just sometime back, Unesco has declared our national anthem Jana Gana Mana as the best in the world. Congratulations everyone. Now please don't say Modi-Shah managed it."

The tweet was liked by more than 23,000 users and retweeted almost 4,500 times.



India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false. Unesco has not made any such announcement. This false claim has been viral on Internet for years.

The exact phrase of Alok's tweet is also being shared on Facebook.
