An old video is being flushed around on social media that shows an airplane moving on a runway covered in water. Please note that this is an old video, nearly 3-year old, and does not depict the present situation at Karachi's JIAP, which is normal, with drains working normally. pic.twitter.com/wcM5VmQbFg — PCAAOfficial (@official_pcaa) July 11, 2022

In the tweet, it was written that ” An old video is being flushed around on social media that shows an airplane moving on a runway covered in water. Please note that this is an old video, nearly 3-year old, and does not depict the present situation at Karachi’s JIAP, which is normal, with drains working normally..”

Apart from this, we also got a report from Duniya News . In which it was mentioned that this video is of August 27 , 2020 . It was also told that the record of 319.2 mm of rain fell, breaking the record of Karachi 1979 . The airport was flooded as a result.
