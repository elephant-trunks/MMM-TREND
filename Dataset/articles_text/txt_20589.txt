A Video of Delhi’s CM Arvind Kejriwal supporting and asking people of Punjab to vote for Shiromani Akali Dal, a Centre-right Sikh –centric state political party in Punjab.

In this video, Kejriwal is praising Shiromani for all the work they have done in Punjab and made it a better state in the past 19 years and will make it better if you will vote and support Akali dal.

Fact Check:

The viral video is the clipped part of the whole video, where kejriwal is seen giving facts checks to people about the Akali Dal. He said that if you the people of Punjab support Akali dal, I am not here to ask you to leave the party and support my party.

Rather I am requesting you to try a new party this time so that Punjab can too be a progressive state, with good schools and hospitals.

This can be seen in the video below:

Conclusion:

The viral video is a clipped part of the real video therefore this is misleading.

Claim Review: Kejriwal’s viral video on supporting Shiromani.
