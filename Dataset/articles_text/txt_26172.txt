A 13-second video of CM Arvind Kejriwal is getting viral on the internet, where he is heard speaking about corruption.

In that video, he said, “I have not seen a single economist writing about corruption ruining the country. Corruption should go on.”

A Facebook user writes, “AAP’s corruption must continue!”
