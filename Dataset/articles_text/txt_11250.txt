Social media is filled with misinformation related to the messaging app WhatsApp after they announced their new privacy policy. Fact Crescendo has debunked such misinformation in the past as well. Amidst this, a WhatsApp message reportedly sent by the “director of WhatsApp”, Varun Pulyani, has been circulating on social media. The message requests users to forward the message to at least 20 contacts. If they fail to do so, they will have to start paying for WhatsApp services.

Fact Crescendo received this message for verification on our WhatsApp Fact Line number 9049053770. The message mentions the following

Fact Check-

We started our investigation by running a keyword search on Google and found that this message has been circulating on different social media platforms since 2014.

Next, we looked into the about us section on WhatsApp website, it mentioned that WhatsApp was founded by Jan Koum and Brian Acton who had previously spent 20 years combined at Yahoo. WhatsApp joined Facebook in 2014, but continues to operate as a separate app with a laser focus on building a messaging service that works fast and reliably anywhere in the world.

We could not find any connection between Varun Pulyani and WhatsApp on the website or any news report.

Upon searching further on WhatsApp website we found that WhatsApp earlier had a subscription model which was cancelled later on in 18th January 2018. The website mentioned “So over the next several weeks, we’ll remove fees from the different versions of our app and WhatsApp will no longer charge you for our service.”

Next we found clarification posts on WhatsApp’s blog stating that the viral message is a hoax.

The company said, “We have been getting a lot of emails and questions from you about this chain letter message circulating in our network: “WhatsApp is going to cost us money soon. The only way that it will stay free is if you are a frequent user i.e. you have at least 10 people you are chatting with. To become a frequent user send this message to 10 people who receive it (2 ticks) and your WhatsApp logo should turn Red to indicate a frequent user.”

Conclusion- Fact Crescendo found that the viral message on social media is False. WhatsApp is not going to charge money for their subscription. WhatsApp has clarified themselves that they will not be charging money.
