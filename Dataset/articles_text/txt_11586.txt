FACT CHECK:

We searched the photograph using ‘Google Reverse Image Search’. What we got in the search is below:

This search gave us the result of a temple named ‘Wat Arun’ in Thailand in Bangkok. This Buddhist temple is also called as the ‘Temple of Dawn’.

We also came across a website called photocory.com, which had many photographs of this temple uploaded on it. We got an identical photograph to our claim, on this website quoted as ‘Steep Stairs at Wat Arun./Scari abrupte’. We have shared that image below.
