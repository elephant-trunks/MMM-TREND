FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did the fact-check, and found it to be false.

On doing a Google Reverse Image Search with one of the keyframes, we found that the same video was uploaded by Sripuram TV on June 3, 2019. The video was shared with a caption: “Her Highness Sheikha Hend Faisal Al Qassemi Visited Sripuram, on 22-02-2019.”

A screenshot of the video was also featured by Amar Ujala in a report, dated May 22, 2022, stating that the UAE Princess Hend Al Qassimi was trolled by Islamic extremists for sharing a four-year-old video of her visiting the Golden temple.

According to The Free Press Journal, Qassimi was married to Prince Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar in 2006. They even had a son, but later separated amicably.

Hence, with the above findings, we can ascertain that the viral claim is misleading.
