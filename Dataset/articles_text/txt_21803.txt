According to police, 17 government vehicles were damaged and over 300 barricades broken by protesting farmers in Delhi on January 26.

Amid this, a set of images showing cars on fire is viral on social media with the claim that these are scenes from the protest. One such caption read, “Latest images from Delhi..”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. These are 2019 images from a protest held in Jammu against the Pulwama terror attack.

AFWA probe

Let us now verify the three images separately.

With the help of reverse image search, we found the above pictures in a 2019 article by “The Quint”. As per the report, the pictures were taken in Jammu on February 15, 2019, during a protest against the killing of 40 CRPF personnel in Pulwama in a suicide attack the day before. Both the pictures are credited to news agency Press Trust of India (PTI).

The caption of the first image says, “Vehicles set on fire by protestors against the killing of CRPF personnel in the Pulwama terror attack, during a shutdown call given by Jammu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JCCI) in Jammu.”

The caption of the second image says, “Policemen patrol a street after vehicles set on fire by protestors against the killing of CRPF personnel in the Pulwama terror attack in Jammu.”

The third picture in the viral set shows protesters gathered around a pile of burning tyres. We traced this picture to the website of international news agency Associated Press.

Hence, it is clear that the images in question are almost two years old and part of a protest held in Jammu after the Pulwama terror attack. These pictures are not related to the violence witnessed in Delhi on January 26.
