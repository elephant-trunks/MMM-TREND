A video of a public brawl went viral on social media with the claim that it showed Muslims fighting over food before Iftar — the first meal after a day’s fasting during Ramzan.

Many shared the video on Twitter. One such post was captioned in Hindi: “After remaining hungry all day during Ramzan, Shantidoots (a common dog-whistle for Muslims) calmly urging each other to eat in the evening.”

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that this incident took place in the Saudi Arabian city of Medina in May 2019. During Ramzan, a group of locals reportedly got into a scuffle over seating before a public Iftar gathering outside the Al-Ghamama Mosque.

Reverse searches of keyframes from the viral video revealed that it has been online since 2019, at least.

Many people shared the viral video in May 2019. While people sharing it at the time condemned the incident for engaging in such violence during the holy month, details were scarce in terms of where and exactly when did this occur.

Narrowing our search to Ramzan in 2019 yielded a few news reports that featured screengrabs from the same video.

This incident was reported on news portals like “Morocco World News” and “Al Araby” in May 2019.

Reportedly, during a public Iftar gathering outside the iconic Al-Ghamama mosque in Medina, Saudi Arabia, a brawl broke out. The news reports said that while the reasons for the fight were not clear, locals on Twitter reported it started as a dispute over seating positions before the food was served.

Thus, we conclude that this video does not show Muslims fighting over food during Iftar. Rather, this video that has been online since at least 2019, showed how a brawl broke out in Medina, over seating arrangements at a public Iftar gathering.
