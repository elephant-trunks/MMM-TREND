FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim, and found it to be misleading.

With a simple Google search and relevant keywords such as ‘Vikram’, ‘Admitted’, ‘Heart Attack’, we found news reports with actor Vikram dispelling rumours about heart attack.

According to reports, Vikram — during an event in Chennai (July 11, 2022) — said that he had a mild heart congestion and was admitted for a day. “They had put images of sick patients as thumbnails for these reports. My face was photoshopped. It was creative,” Vikram was quoted by The News Minute as saying. These reports can be seen here, here and here.

Actor Vikram was admitted to a hospital in Chennai on Friday (July 8).

Hence, with the above information, we can conclude that the viral post showing actor Vikram suffering a heart attack is misleading.
