On social media, a video of a man’s arrest is circulating with the claim that it shows Srinagar Police arresting a terrorist. The video shows a police jeep apparently knocking down a motorcycle and then a cop landing a flying kick at the rider and pinning him down.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is from Brazil and not Srinagar.
