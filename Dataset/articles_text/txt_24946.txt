As many as 36,000 km of rural roads built; highway building increased to 12 km/day from 2 km/day, and cashless treatment for accident victims on national highways.These are some of the claims made by the Ministry of Road Transport in its performance report card, issued a year after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first year in office.

However, a look at the figures projected as key achievements shows that the claims are biased or incorrect, and the schemes projected as fresh initiatives have been in existence for years. Here is what Fact Checker found:

1.“Significant” increase in rural road: Yes, but lesser than some past years

Claim: Roads constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), Prime Minister’s Rural Road Development Programme, have “significantly” increased from 25,262 km in 2013-14 to 36,883 km in 2014-15.

Reality: More roads were constructed under PMGSY during 2014-15, compared to 2013-14. However, far greater lengths have been constructed: 60,117 km in 2009-10 and 45,109 km in 2010-11.

Year Road Length Under PMGSY (in km) 2009-10 60,117 2010-11 45,109 2011-12 30,995 2012-13 24,161 2013-14 25,316 2014-15 (Up to Feb 15) 30,647 2014-15 36,883*

2. Highways built at 12 km/day instead of UPA’s 2 km/day: Wrong, says government’s own data

Claim: Only 2 km per day constructed between 2009 and 2014. The current government has increased it to 12 km/day.

Year Completed Length of Roads/NHs (in km) Length constructed per day (km/day) 2009-10 5145 14.1 2010-11 4438 12.2 2011-12 5013 13.7 2012-13 5732 15.7 2013-14 (till Oct ‘13) 1817 8.7

"text-align: justify;">More than 12 km/day was being constructed during 2009-14, with a high of more than 15 km/day during 2012-13, the government’s own data says.

3. More highway contracts than previous year. Yes, but lesser than years before that

Year Highway Projects Awarded (in Kms) 2011-12 9,791 2012-13 9,500 2013-14 3,621 2014-15 7,972
