Police, RSS goons beating up students at Rohith protest in Delhi

Video of the brutal assault by the police and RSS goons against students who marched to the RSS office today (30 January 2016) in protest against the institutional murder of Rohith Vemula at Hyderabad Central University. The students demanded punishment to those who led the harassment and victimisation at the behest of the RSS-BJP which led to the death of Rohith. The students were demanding action against HCU VC Appa Rao and Union ministers Bandaru Dattatreya and Smriti Irani, and they were brutally beaten up by the police, joined in by RSS goons. Many media persons also were beaten up and their cameras smashed by the police. Our fight for justice for Rohith would go on, our struggle against casteism will move forward, battling casteist and communal-fascist forces like the RSS at every step.
