A viral graphic claiming the name of Seema Samridhi Kushwaha, the legal counsel who fought for the Nirbhaya gangrape victim, has featured in a list of 'World's 6 Most Talented Women' is being shared on social media.



BOOM found that the claim in the viral graphic is not backed by any credible news source.

Seema Samridhi Kushwaha, currently an advocate in the Supreme Court of India, represented the victim's family in the infamous Nirbhaya gangrape case in 2012. Kushwaha had joined the Bahujan Samaj Party in January 2022, ahead of Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.
