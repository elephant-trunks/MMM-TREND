Scenes from an Al Jazeera documentary about the Islamic State (ISIS) giving arms training to young children in Afghanistan, is being shared with a false claim that it shows madrasas in India teaching children to pick up arms.

BOOM found that the video is from a documentary made by Al Jazeera, showing how the terrorist organisation trains young children how to operate arms and handle grenades in Afghanistan.

The video is being shared as India is seeing violent communal clashes in several parts of the country including the capital, Delhi.

The one minute 42 seconds video is being shared with text in Hindi that translates to 'students getting higher education in Madrasas'.

(Original text in Hindi - मदरसे में छात्र उच्च शिक्षा प्राप्त करते हुए)

FACT CHECK



We noticed that there were English subtitles to the video and the logo of Qatar-based news agency Al Jazeera is visible at the bottom left corner of the clip at the 14 second mark.

We then ran a Google reverse image search using keywords like Al Jazeera and children using arms and found a story published by the Al Jazeera about a documentary titled 'ISIL and the Taliban'. The story published on November 1, 2015 had the full documentary embedded and described how Najibullah Quraishi and Jamie Doran, gained "unprecedented access to ISIL's central leadership and met children as young as five years old being trained to fight and dedicate their lives to the 'caliphate'.

The story had embedded photos used in the documentary and one of the images matched the scene in the viral video.
