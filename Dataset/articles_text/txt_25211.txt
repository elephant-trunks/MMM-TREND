TRUTH

The video contains a logo on the top-left corner which says “Toplum TV”. A quick search reveals that Toplum TV is a news channel in Azerbaijan. Using reverse-image search on the video frames, we landed on an article about the anti-government protests in Baku, Azerbaijan from October 19, 2019.

Upon searching, we found numerous videos from October 2019. They were reporting the Azerbaijani protests, many covering the same incidents depicted in the video in question.

It can also be clearly seen that the uniform of the law enforcement spell “polis”, which is the Azerbaijani spelling for “police”. On the other hand, it is spelt as “policía” in Spanish.

Result

FAKE. While the video is authentic, the caption associated with it is completely false.
