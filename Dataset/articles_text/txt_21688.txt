Violence broke out in West Bengal soon after results of the assembly elections were announced on May 2. Several political workers, mainly of Opposition parties, have been killed or injured, and party offices, houses and shops targeted according to reports.

On social media, a video of a mob attacking a police van is circulating with the claim that it shows Trinamool Congress supporters attacking cops who’d come to control post-poll clashes. The caption with the video says, “#PresidentRuleInBengal Policeman came to control the situation & then TMC goons attacks on Police. #tmcgoons #BengalViolence”.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading. The video is of a clash that broke out between police and locals over the death of a youth in Odisha in January 2021.
