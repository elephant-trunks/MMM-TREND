Ganesh Chaturthi is round the corner, and Covid restrictions have done little to stem the enthusiasm among devotees. Mumbai, especially, is all decked up to welcome Ganpati Bappa on September 10.

Lalbaugcha Raja in Mumbai's Lalbaug area is one of the biggest and most popular destinations for devotees. Lakhs of people thronged the area every year in the pre-Covid era to seek Lord Ganesha's blessings. Glitzy 'mukh darshan' videos on social media have not only captivated ordinary Mumbaikars, but also Bollywood personalities for years.

And on Wednesday, September 8, superstar Amitabh Bachchan shared on social media what he called was the first darshan of Lalbaugcha Raja.

Several media outlets followed up with reports based on Bachchan's posts. The archived version can be seen here.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is actually from 2016. It shows the 'mukh darshan' of Lalbaugcha Raja, which is kept for public display for 11 days during Ganesh Chaturthi before being immersed in the Arabian Sea.

AFWA probe

Using InVID tool, we extracted key frames from the video, reverse-searching which we found the exact video uploaded on a YouTube channel on September 3, 2016. The video description said it is the first look (mukh darshan) of Lalbaugcha Raja.

We also found the 2016 promo video of Lalbaugcha Raja. Bachchan himself can be seen in the video.

Hence, it is clear that the video posted by megastar Amitabh Bachchan is not of this year's Lalbaugcha Raja. The video is five years old of the same event.
