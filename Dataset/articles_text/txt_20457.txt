Fact Check:

We at DFRAC reverse search the video to know the entire truth behind the video. We find that the video is from a rally led by Praveen Bhai Togadia, founder of the International Hindu Parishad.

Actually , Praveen Bhai Togadia has announced a new party while holding a resolution meeting in Ayodhya. Attacking the BJP, he said that those who fought elections in the name of Ram forgot Ram as soon as they got power. He along with his supporters gave the slogan of ‘Abki Baar Hindu ki Sarkar’.

As can be read in the “AMAR UJALA” headline, “Praveen Togadia announced a new party in Ayodhya, said- this time, the government of Hindus. (translates hindi)

A Facebook user too shared this video stating, “Under the leadership of Praveen Togadia ji, there is an influx of Ram devotees for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya. (translates hindi)
