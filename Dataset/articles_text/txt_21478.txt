India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The picture is of the delegation-level meeting between Indian and Russian National Security Advisers. Meetings with intelligence officials of other countries were held separately.

Using reverse image search, we found that the viral picture was published on several news websites recently.

As per these articles, on September 8, 2021, a delegation-level meeting took place between India and Russia in New Delhi. National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval and his Russian counterpart Nikolay Patrushev discussed the “prevailing situation in Afghanistan following its takeover by the Taliban and its security implications for India, Russia and the Central Asian region”.

News agency ANI had tweeted these images on September 8 with the caption, “Delhi: A delegation-level talk of National Security Advisors (NSA) between India & Russia underway.”

We found another article by “Hindustan Times” published on the same day with the headline, “MI6, CIA chiefs and Russia’s Security Council secretary make beeline for India".

As per this article, Nikolay Patrushev, the secretary of Russia’s security council; Richard Moore, the head of UK’s Secret Intelligence Service or MI6; and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director William Burns met Doval separately. This was also reported by other news outlets during the same time.
