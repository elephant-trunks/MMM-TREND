Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann tied the knot with Dr Gurpreet Kaur in a private ceremony on July 7, 2022.

In the above context, an image of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has gone viral on social media, in which he is seen eating food. The image is shared with a caption, claiming that it is of Kejriwal during Mann’s wedding.

The video is shared with the caption: “#तस्वीर डायरेक्ट #from भगवंत मान जी की शादी से…” (English translation: “Photo direct from Bhagwant Mann’s wedding”)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did the fact-check, and found it to be misleading.

On doing a Google Reverse Image Search, we found the same image uploaded by a Facebook page on April 3, 2018.

The image was shared with a Hindi caption: “कहीं देखी है ऐसी सादगी? हनुमान जयंती भण्डारे में भोजन करते मुख्यमंत्री अरविंद केजरीवाल और दिल्ली सरकार के मंत्री कैलाश गहलोत” (English translation: “Have you ever seen such simplicity? Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal along with Delhi government’s minister Kailash Gehlot eating food during Hanuman Jayanti Bhandara”)

We found that the official Twitter handle of AAP had also shared the same photo on April 3, 2018, with a caption: “CM @ArvindKejriwal attends Bhandara organised by the employees of Delhi Secretariat. AK is truly #JantaKaCM. He doesn’t prefer any VIP treatment”

Tribune NewsLine also reported about it on April 3, 2018.

Thus, we can ascertain that the viral claim attached to the picture of Delhi CM is misleading.
