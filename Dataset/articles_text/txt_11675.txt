Claim

According to a social media post, UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan presented Prime Minister Modi with a gold necklace as a sign of appreciation. According to the claim, the UAE, which took issue with Nupur Sharma’s contentious statement, now respects PM Modi.

Fact

Upon conducting a keyword search, Newschecker found that the video was from August 2019 and not recent. The “Order of Zayed,” the highest honour bestowed by the UAE, was given to Prime Minister Modi at that time. News organisation ANI provided a video of this incident in which a portion of the viral video can be seen.

PM Modi himself tweeted to let people know about the accolade on 24th August, 2019. This medal is bestowed in Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan’s honour, the founding leader of the United Arab Emirates. Our investigation has established that PM Modi received this distinction from the UAE roughly three years ago and it’s unrelated to Nupur Sharma’s case.
