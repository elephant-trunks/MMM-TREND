The communal clash in Karauli has created tension in the wind of Rajasthan as well as hate and opinions on the walls of social media. After the incident, many people are raising questions about why people remain silent when Muslims are attacked and protest when the house of Hindus are burned.

Harun khan هارون خان posted a short clip of 27 seconds in which right-wingers are raising saffron flags in front and shouting in front of the mosque. Users are claiming that they are human right activist and keen to protest against the violence that happened to Hindus in Karauli Rajasthan.

Fact check

After doing the reverse image search, we found an article of Aljazeera in which they have inserted the image of the viral protest. As per the article, Tejasvi Surya organized a cycle rally where he along with other BJP MP’s rallied from Bangalore city to Kolar city in Karnataka under the name of Fit India Movement on 27th March.

Cyclists from Kolar led by their energetic MP Shri @bjp_muniswamy joined the #Cycle2Freedom ride at Narsapura in large numbers. Grateful to them for adding strength & joining the #FitIndia movement.#AzadiKaAmritMahotsav @BJYM pic.twitter.com/FuXnn8obpe — Tejasvi Surya (ಮೋದಿಯ ಪರಿವಾರ) (@Tejasvi_Surya) March 27, 2022

Further, when they came near the Mosque, bikers started dancing, shouting or behaving in an undisciplined manner. While this incident took place in Kolar city of Karnataka and comes under the case where Muslims were aggressive after hearing about the Muslim women selling App.

Mohammed Irshad also posted the viral clip of saffron flag holders protesting in front of the mosque on 29th March.

Tejasvi Surya had organised a cycle rally from Bangalore to Kolar on March 21. When the rally reached the Hussaini Makan Masjid of Kolar the people who participated in the rally stopped and started doing this nuisance. What is the message? pic.twitter.com/9UwiZlGbEm — Mohammed Irshad (@Shaad_Bajpe) March 29, 2022

Hence proves that the video is old and does not have a connection with the Karauli incident as violence in Karauli happened near the 4th of April and the viral video got on air on the 29th of March.

Conclusion: Therefore, the claim is misleading.
