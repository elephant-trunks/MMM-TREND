Hundreds of Reliance Jio towers in Punjab were vandalised as farmers’ protests continue against alleged corporatisation of agriculture. Following this, mobile and Internet services of the company were disrupted in several parts of the state.

Many Opposition leaders and protesting farmers have alleged that the new farm laws are in favour of industry leaders such as Reliance’s Mukesh Ambani and Adani Group’s Gautam Adani. Earlier, some protesters had called for a nationwide boycott of all Reliance and Adani products, including Jio SIM cards.

In this context, a short video clip of a burning mobile tower is circulating on social media with the claim that it is a Jio tower set on fire during the farmers’ agitation. The caption in Hindi with one such video translates to, “Effect of farmers’ movement! Jio tower set on fire”.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. This is a 2017 video from Dehradun and not related to the ongoing farmers’ agitation.

Using appropriate keywords, we found a longer version of the same video in a “News18” report dated June 29, 2017.

According to the report, the video is from Vasant Vihar police station area of Uttarakhand’s Dehradun, where a mobile tower on the rooftop of a house caught fire due to short circuit.

We also found a similar report on the incident by “Amar Ujala” published on June 28, 2017.

Here is a comparison between a screen grab from the viral video and an image from the Dehradun incident carried by “Amar Ujala”.

A longer version of the video in question was also uploaded on a YouTube channel called “BOOPATHI VIEWS” on September 20, 2017.

Hence, it is clear that though several Jio towers were recently targeted in Punjab, the video being circulated is more than three years old and not related to the ongoing farmers’ protest.
