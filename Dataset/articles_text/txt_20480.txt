Fact Check:

To prove this as misleading news chaundali police have tweeted on their official Twitter account. Stating, “The case is more than a year old in which departmental action has been taken by suspending both the policemen at the time due to the inhuman treatment done to the child. Please refrain from circulating anything without full facts and clear information.”(Translates Hindi)

The video was of the year 2021 , and Amar Ujala too covered it at that time.

Conclusion:

The video is not of recent times but of the year 2021, where the minor was beaten up because of a charge of stealing and not of raising Pro –Pakistani slogans.

Claim Review: Minors beaten up in UP for raising Pro-Pakistani slogans.
