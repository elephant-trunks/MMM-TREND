Spread the truth:

Quotes days ago were words of wisdom by known people, inspiring others looking upto them, but there had been changes, now these quotes quite much consists of controversy, shocking, stupidity of ‘known’ people/celebrities/politicians etc.

Member of controversial quote group undeniably is Arundhati Roy, she had caused furore many times before. But This particular piece of text or quote is false. She nowhere was found to have said this. The people who posted, on questioning merely said “found on net” which actually is a proof of biasness, if you hate someone, everything you come across against that person is true, no need of fact check. This actually is one of the way Fake News spreads and this is a shining example.

Few of her real controversial quotes forming base of hatred from selected people are –

“Kashmir has never been an integral part of India. It is a historical fact. Even the Indian Government has accepted this.” “I write this from Srinagar, Kashmir. This morning’s papers say that I may be arrested on charges of sedition for what I have said at recent public meetings on Kashmir. I said what millions of people here say every day. I said what I, as well as other commentators have written and said for years.” “I am on this side of line. I do not care…pick me up put me in jail.” “There should be unconditional talks with the Maoists.”

But this, an imaginary quote typed on her photo from an interview on BBC Channel is viral.

“Mothers and teachers terrorize millions of kids everyday at home and at school. Islamic terrorism is not even 0.01 percent compared to that”



If one still has common sense left, such text can only result in two outcomes, either it’s fake or it was humor, and if it really was humor, it must be in maintream media.

The earliest tweet found was by Rishi Bagree who has been good with spreading Fake News and infact have blocked fact checkers on twitter too, for instance SMHoaxSlayer, so they can not catch right on the time.

When asked, she denied creating the Fake News which is an acceptance of spreading it. for e.g Drug peddlers don’t create stuff but do distribute.

I haven't created this. It's being circulated all over SM. Can't vouch for its authenticity. — Shuchi Singh Kalra (@shuchikalra) January 22, 2018

One more from the list is Gita S. Kapoor

Mothers and teachers make the kids sex slaves, throw their LGBT kids from terraces, behead non believers, kill, maim, bombard. I think her teacher/mum must've hung her by her thumbs for being a witch. pic.twitter.com/LuUAW5mvE4 — Gita S. Kapoor (@GitaSKapoor) January 21, 2018

Ha ha! Arundhati Roy is as unhinged as she looks. In another life, she could be Ed Gein's nuttier sister, making him look saner in comparison. 😂 Of all the apologists for Islamic terrorism, this one takes away the cake. @JustinTrudeau consider inducting her into your cabinet. pic.twitter.com/X3dL8XizKA — Reah J.
