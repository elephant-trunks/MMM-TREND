Truth

The collage being circulated online is misleading. This picture of Mamata Banerjee was clicked a few seconds before she actually greeted the Prime Minister with a “namaste”.

According to a video uploaded by the official Facebook page of NDTV, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached Kolkata on 22nd May at around 11 AM and was immediately greeted first by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and then by the other Bengal officials. PM Modi can even be seen conversing with Mamata Banerjee for a few seconds upon his arrival, before moving towards the other dignitaries.

For further confirmation, an India Today video can be referred to that was uploaded on their official Youtube account.

Thus, the claim that Mamata Banerjee did not greet the PM upon his arrival is False.
