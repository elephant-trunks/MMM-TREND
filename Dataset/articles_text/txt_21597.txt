An image of an elderly man on oxygen support and his feet chained to the footboard of the hospital bed went viral on social media with the claim that the man in the photo is late Fr Swamy.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the man in the viral image is not Fr Swamy but Baburam Balwan Singh, a convicted murderer, who was admitted at a government hospital in Uttar Pradesh's Etah.
