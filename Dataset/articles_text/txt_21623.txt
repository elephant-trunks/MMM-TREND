An emotional video of an apparent soldier saying goodbye to his family amid heavy gunfire is circulating on social media. The man records a message saying he might not be able to return home and asks his brother to take care of their mother.

“Soldier says goodbye to family during war,” reads the accompanying caption. One Twitter user said that the video is of an Iraqi soldier fighting the ISIS.

A Facebook user commented on the viral post that the video is part of a movie and shared its YouTube link. The 17-minute-long film named “Dialing” was directed by one Bahaa Al-Kazemi, according to the video title. The YouTube channel is also in the name of the same person.

The viral portion can be seen at the starting of the YouTube video. It was uploaded on the channel in 2017.

According to the video description in Arabic, the movie tells the story of an Iraqi woman whose son was a soldier and died fighting the ISIS. The description also touches upon the social media confusion as to whether or not it is a real video.

The soldier’s role was played by an Arabic artist named Menhel Abbas. He had shared the video on Instagram.

The short film was released in 2015 and also premiered at the Dubai International Film Festival. DIFF had uploaded the film on its YouTube channel the same year.

Hence, it’s clear that the viral video is not real, and is part of an Arabic short film.
