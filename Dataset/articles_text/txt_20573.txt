In short- a video is going viral of Arvind Kejriwal with a claim that he’s a BJP Man.

Fact check

After seeing the original video of CM’s interview on NDTV, we witnessed no such claims made by Delhi CM in his interview regarding his connection with BJP. Another proof if you look upon the frame closely, you will find a line popping out in the middle of the frame. ‘Our Focus is Development, Positive Feedback’ are the lines. Meanwhile, in the original video, Kejriwal can only be heard speaking about his alliance with Anna Hazare and Aam Janta Party’s efficiency when those lines show up in the video.

In the article, NDTV has only mentioned Kejriwal’s statement regarding Shaheen Bagh and the video was posted on 4th February 2020. Therefore the video is edited and fake.

Conclusion- Our fact check proves that Arvind Kejriwal didn’t mention his connection with BJP rather he spoke about the efficiency of the AAP Party in the video during the time duration which has been edited in the viral video.
