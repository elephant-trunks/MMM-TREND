A tweet is getting viral on Twitter account from a person named Vijay Gopal in which he seems to thrash Telangana Govt. for removing the maximum working hours limit in an organization (IT and ITES Company). He claimed that this way the Telangana government is forcing the people to work for more than 100 hours, where other states have 50-60 hours limit in a week.

He also claimed about the other problems like the companies removing lunch breaks and other breaks from the calculations and underpaying the employees, and do not even pay for their overtime.

Did you know; TS Govt. in 2019 removed maximum working hours limit (to work in an organization) in IT &ITES companies, essentially allowing companies to make you work for 100+ hours also a week? while other states have 54-60 hours limit/week, we hv nothing. @KTRTRS @jayesh_ranjan — Vijay Gopal (@VijayGopal_) January 24, 2022

Fact Check :

In his tweet, a statement was issued by Dileep Konatham, director of the government of Telangana asking him not to spread the fake news and mislead the people for the same. He further explained that the government has given certain exceptions to IT and ITES companies in the year 2002 (GO and MS no dated 30/05/2002)

Further in his statement he also informed about the renewing of GO every 5 years to ensure smooth functioning of the companies of the states.

Dear Vijay Gopal, Pls refrain from spreading Fake news. This is the 2nd time I am calling you out for posting misleading info. The GO giving certain exemptions to IT & ITES sector was first introduced in 2002, by the then Andhra Pradesh Govt! (GO MS No 16 dated 30/05/2002) 1/n https://t.co/IlIoHz7kbW — Konatham Dileep (@KonathamDileep) January 24, 2022

Conclusion

With Konatham Dileep, director of the government of Telangana coming forward and claiming this as a false acquisition by confirming through his tweet, proves that the tweet was misleading.
