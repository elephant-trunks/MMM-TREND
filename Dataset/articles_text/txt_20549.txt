Russia has vetoed disapproval and aggression when UN Chief Antonio Guterres mentioned that Russian troops should return to their region. Russia-Ukraine war is escalating destruction in Ukraine. Meanwhile, a picture of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is getting viral on social media. In the picture, we can see Zelenskyy has put on the military costume. Users are captioning the picture as the sight of bravery shown by him.

Shubham Khobragade writes, “This is the President of Ukraine Zelensky He took off his clothes and put on a military uniform to join the troops in fighting to protect the Ukrainian homeland. He is a true leader.”

Fact check

After sharing a glance over the picture, we researched further and found the same image of president Zelenskyy on the Getty image. The image was uploaded on December 6, 2021, when Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the military in Donbas.

Conclusion: Hence proving that the viral claim over Ukraine’s President joining the military to fight against Russia is misleading.
