There was a riot of laughter of sorts on social media after a video surfaced showing a man addressing a crowd as his pants fell off in the middle of an event.

Some users have claimed that the man in the video is a BJP candidate from Rajasthan, while others identified him as Congress candidate Rakesh Parikh.

The video has been shared more than 6,000 times on Facebook.

Among others, this video has been shared by Deepak Singh, who claims he himself is a Member of the Legislative Council from Uttar Pradesh.

India Today Fact Check found the claim to be false. The man in the video is neither a candidate from the Congress nor the BJP. The man is identified as Mohd Umar Siddique, former chairman of Nagar Palika Parishad in Uttarakhand's Jaspur. Interestingly, there is a striking resemblance between Siddique and Parikh.

When we searched the Internet, we found an article on news portal Rajyasameeksha.org.

The article mentioned that during the campaigning for Udham Singh Nagar municipal polls, Siddique's pants fell off.

Taking this as a reference, we reached out to Siddique. He told India Today, "Unfortunately, my pants did drop off while I was campaigning for polls last month."

When asked about which party he was associated with, Siddique said, "I was earlier with the BSP and now with Uttarakhand Kranti Dal but have no connection with the BJP or the Congress."

Speaking to India Today, Parikh who is contesting polls from Rajasthan's Masuda said, "The man in the video is not me. I rarely wear pant-shirt during campaigning. I mostly wear traditional kurta-pyjama."

Based on our findings, we established that the man in the video is neither a Congress nor a BJP candidate.
