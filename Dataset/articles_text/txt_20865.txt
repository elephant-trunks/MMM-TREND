Since the morning of October 9,2021, two images have been circulating on social media. These two images show injured soldiers making their way through a rocky region and the second seems to be showing a skirmish of some sort.

One user from Pakistan claimed that one of the soldiers in the picture is Indian Air Force officer Abhinandan Varth aman who was famously captured by Pakistani forces in March 2019.

Fact-Check:

Upon performing keyword searches along with a reverse image search on two images we found Open Source Intelligence’s tweet which clarified the issue for us.

They have made it very clear that the images are old and date back to the Galwan Valley standoff in 2020. Additionally, we looked through Chinese state media sights to see whether any such images were released recently and ended up finding nothing. Therefore, this claim is misleading.
