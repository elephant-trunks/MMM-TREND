Amid International Women's Day celebrations on March 8, two pictures of a young girl in hijab with policemen are going viral with the claim that a 24-year-old Muslim girl in Mumbai qualified the Indian Administrative Services (IAS) exam.

While one of the images shows the girl sitting on a chair surrounded by policemen, the other shows cops saluting her.

Facebook Page Burhan for "Kishtwar" posted the pictures with the caption, "24 Year's Old Indian Muslim Girl Qualifies IAS in Maharashtra Mumbai".

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the photos to be misleading. The girl seen in the photos was made district superintendent of police (DSP) just for a day in Maharashtra's Buldhana district ahead of International Women's Day.

Many Facebook users have shared the misleading post. The archived version of the post can be seen here.

With the help of reverse search, we found a YouTube video of "The Times of India" regarding the incident. As per this news report, 14-year-old Sahrish Kanwal of the Zilla Parishad Urdu High School in Malkapur tehsil took over as DSP for a day in Maharashtra's Buldhana district.

The district administration had taken the initiative just before International Women's Day to motivate girls and allow them to experience how officials function and also address other issues.

The week-long initiative was conceptualised by Buldhana collector Suman Chandra and the administration is also celebrating 'Pink Week', focusing on women's health.

The Times of India had published a detailed report on the same on March 5.

Therefore, it is clear that the girl seen in the viral photos has not cracked the IAS exam but took over as DSP for a day.
