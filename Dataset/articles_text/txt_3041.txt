A video of a newborn infant has surfaced on the internet in which the baby looks pale in a sensitive situation and all the veins on the body are clearly visible. Several claims have been made about the child and the location.

According to one of the claims, given the infant’s condition, he/she was injected 50 times with poison but the child still survived. Several other posts claimed that the video is recent and from different places like Shamli in UP or Mewat.

One of the Facebook posts read: “अजीबोगरीब बच्चा पैदा हुआ जो 50 इंजेक्शन लगाने के बाद भी नही मरा”

(English Translation: “Weird baby born who didn’t die even after 50 injections”)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above video and found the claims attached to it to be false.

We extracted keyframes of the video through InVid tool and put them through Google Reverse Image Search. The search led us to several news reports with screengrabs of the video in question.

According to reports, the infant in the viral video was born on June 3, 2022, at Mother and Child Hospital (MCH) in Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh. The child suffered from a rare genetic condition due to which the infant did not develop skin. These reports can be seen here, here and here.

None of the reports mentions injecting the infant with poison. However, an Aaj Tak report quoted Dr Naved Qureshi, in charge of ICU at MCH Ratlam stating that the child was suffering from ‘Harlequin Ichthyosis’ and he passed away 4-5 days after the birth.

In conclusion, the above findings establish that the claims attached to the video are baseless.
