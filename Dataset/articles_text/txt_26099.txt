A video is being shared on social media. It is being claimed that women of the Hindu community are being mistreated in Pakistan. These women have been thrashed by a mob and stripped of their clothes and made naked.

Sharing this video on Twitter, a user named Pandit Kalkiram wrote – “The scene of the brutality being done to Hindus in Pakistan is disturbing. What justice can be expected from all the Islamic countries of the world including @UN, who advocates humanity and @OIC_OCI, who leads the Islamic world. @HumaneSociety @UNHumanRights @POTUS”

Fact Check:

Our team investigated the claim of the video going viral. We searched most of the keywords on Google. This have been published on the website of ‘News-18 Hindi’ on December 10, 2021 with the title- “Shameful video surfaced from Pakistan, clothes of girls exposed on the streets of Chorni Bata”.

According to this report, these women, who were rag pickers in Faisalabad, Pakistan, were inhumanely treated by a shopkeeper by accusing them of theft. Many screenshots published in this report have been photographed of the same women who are in the viral video. There is no mention anywhere in this report that these women belong to the Hindu community. At the same time, many other websites and media houses have covered this incident. But nowhere it is written that they are women of the Hindu community.

At the same time, Pakistani journalist Reem Khurshid also tweeted on this incident on 7 December 2021 and criticized the incident.

“Hi Allah” is being said by the women who are being abused in the video. This signifies the women probably belong to the Muslim community.

Conclusion:

The investigation of DFRAC proves that the women who are being treated inhumanly do not belong to the Hindu community. Hence the claim being made by social media users is misleading.
