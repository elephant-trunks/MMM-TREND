Amid the recently declared Agnipath scheme launched by the government, many news are around the corner some with real claims others with false claims.

Similarly, a letter is getting viral on social media from the defence ministry the letter reads, “I am directed to refer to this Ministry’s letter no. F.No. 9 (11/2027/F dated 17 June 2022, on the subject sited above and to say that the ORs attested after 01 January 2013 and not promoted to the substantive rank of Naik or equivalent on 01 July 2022 are to be kept under the new Agnipath Scheme….”

It is being claimed in the letter that, the Ministry of Defence has ordered personnel under Other Ranks (ORs) attested after January 1, 2019, and not promoted to a substantive rank of Naik or equivalent as of July 1, 2022, are to be kept under the Agnipath Scheme.

Many social media users are sharing this letter with concern a user on Twitter writes, “I only hope that this letter is fake otherwise the repercussions are going to be very serious. It would invite endless litigation.”
