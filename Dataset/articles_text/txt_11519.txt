On 20th August 2019, a Facebook page called “SA Hindus” posted a video, captioned, “Yesterday the ISKCON temple was flooded due to heavy rains in Vrindavan, however Lord Krishna’s devotees kept reciting hymns. Jai Sri Krishna | Radhe Radhe | in this video, we can see the devotees of Lord Krishna worshipping in the courtyard of the temple. This video was shared on social media and it is being claimed that this incident took place at the ISKCON temple in Vrindavan where there has been flooding inside the temple due to the recent heavy rains. By the time the fact check was done, this video had received over 350 responses.

We started the investigation on YouTube using keywords like “ISKCON flood”, as a result of which we found a video uploaded by Radheshyam ji on 10th August 2015, captioned as “ISKCON Flooded in Mayapur August 2015, Puja performed by Panchatatva Prakash Das. “

After this we contacted Dharmatdas, the secretary of ISKCON Vrindavan, he told us that “this incident is not from Vrindavan but this video is very old and is from the ISKCON temple in Mayapur, West Bengal. There has never been so much rain in Vrindavan for water to get filled up in the temple. This is just a rumor.”

After this we got a live video published by the ISKCON Vrindavan Facebook page on 19 August 2019 where we can clearly see that there is no such flood. One such live video can also be seen on 21 August 2019. On the news website of ISKCON on 5 August 2015, we got a detailed description of the incident shown in this video, which you can read by clicking on the link given below.

Conclusion: After checking the facts we have found the above post to be incorrect. This video is not from the Vrindavan ISKCON temple. This video is from West Bengal and it was made in 2015 when flood waters entered the ISKCON temple in Mayapur. Recently no such incident has taken place in the Vrindavan ISKCON temple.
