A video is circulated on social media at a fast pace, showing some Army personnel helping people during heavy rain.

The video is shared with a caption: “भारी बारिश के चलते राजस्थान श्रीगंगानगर में सेना से मांगी मदद : श्रीगंगानगर में 43 साल का रिकॉर्ड टूटा, कई शहरों में बाढ़ के हालात।” (English translation: Rajasthan seeks help from Army in Sri Ganganagar due to heavy rains: Forty-three years of record broken in Sri Ganganagar, flood situation in many cities”)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did the fact-check, and found it to be misleading.

On doing a Google Reverse Image Search with one of the keyframes, we found the same video uploaded by Amar Ujala on October 19, 2021. According to the report, Army personnel rescued people stuck in a shop due to heavy rainfall in Nainital, Uttarakhand.

ABP Live also uploaded the same video on October 19, 2021, claiming that it is of Nainital, Uttarakhand, where Army personnel performed a rescue operation at Mall Road.

Thus, based on the above information, it is clear that the viral video is not from Rajasthan.
