The number of rural households using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking increased by 17.3 percentage points, twice the rate of urban households (8.7 percentage points) between 2011 and 2016, according to a survey of more than 300,000 households across 25 states completed in August 2016 by People Research on India's Consumer Economy, a New Delhi-based think tank.

The use of LPG in rural households increased to 32.5% in 2016 from 15.3% in 2011. The share of urban households using LPG rose to 81.7% in 2016 from 73% in 2011.

The usage increase was slightly higher in rural households than the all-India average of 16.9 percentage points in six years to 2016.

The share of households using firewood/dung cake declined to 63.7% for rural areas in 2016 from 78% in 2011, and to 13.6% for urban areas from 16.8%.

Use of solid fuel like firewood and dung cakes causes premature death from illnesses like pneumonia, stroke and lung cancer, according to World Health Organization .
