FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above post, and found it to be misleading.

We initiated our probe with a keyword search on Google, but we did not find any reliable report of a terrorist being arrested. The Reverse Image Search with keyframes also did not lead us to any substantial evidence.

NewsMobile then contacted Faridabad Police’s Sube Singh, who confirmed that the video in question was being shared with a misleading claim. In fact, it was a mock drill which was conducted at the Faridabad Metro Station.

On June 26, 2022, in a tweet, Faridabad Police also rubbished the claims of a terrorist being arrested.

So, in conclusion, it is proved that the claim attached to the video in question is FAKE.
