A video, showing few people offering a long piece of cloth to a river, is being shared on social media with a claim that the video shows the tradition of offering saree to River Narmada.

The video is shared with the caption: “नर्मदा नदी को साड़ी भी पहनाई जाती है। देखें यह अद्भुत नजारा” (English translation: Saree is also offered to Narmada river. See this incredible view)

Here’s the link to the above post.

FACT CHECK

When NewsMobile fact-checked the post, it found the clip was taken from a movie.

We extracted the keyframes of the video and put it through a Reverse Image Search. We found that the same video was shared on YouTube, dated June 14, 2019, with the title: “Reva movie scene (Namami Narmade) Jay Jay Garavi Gujarat”

The same scene was shared by several channels with a similar title stating that the scene was taken from a movie. See the video here and here.

Taking a cue from this, we ran a search and found that Reva — a Gujarati adventure drama film — won the National Film Award for best Gujarati film in 2018 . The film is based on the Gujarati novel Tatvamasi by Dhruv Bhatt.

From the above information, we could establish that the video clips were taken from a movie. We ran a keyword search and found several media reports from 2017, stating that ‘Over 3,055 metre-long saree dipped in Narmada river ahead of Modi visit.’ The report mentioned that on March 6, a day prior to the inauguration of India’s longest cable bridge in Bharuch by PM Modi, the Bharuch administration attempted a Guinness World Record of dipping a 3,055-metre long saree in the Narmada river.

We also found the video of the same on YouTube.

Hence, we conclude that a clip from a 2018 Gujarati film is being shared with a misleading claim.
