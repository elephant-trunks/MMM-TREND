On August 30 and 31, 2021 many reports of Janmashtami processions in Kashmir were published by news media sites and on social media.

Many reported this procession to be taking place for the first time in 32 years.

Outlets such as News18, Zee news and Sudarshan News claimed this a triumph after the abrogation of article 370 and 35A.

Fact-Check:

Upon researching the claim, we found that Janmashtami parades have been taking place regularly since 2000. We found several images of processions taken out 2007,2012 and 2013.

Only in the last two years , celebration did not take place because of security issues in 2019 and because of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Since the processions had been regularly taking place for more than a decade, the claim that this procession took place after 32 years is fake.
