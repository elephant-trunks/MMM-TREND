Our Haryana was defamed and was seen as a state that kill girls. We then ran a campaign. The gender ratio which earlier was 850 girls/1000 boys has now reached up to to 933 girls/1000 boys. This was a huge work, a challenge, this is a work for change in society. Elderly, youth/old will understand there may come a time when number of girls will be lesser than boys. Our Dhankad Ji has said, we will bring girls from Bihar. Now, some are saying, now that Kashmir is open and we can bring them girls from there. Jokes apart, but if the gender ratio is correct, then there will be balance in the society. So, we all have to participate in this.

So it’s clear that he based his sentence on what others are saying claiming it to be not real, humor. It also is not clear about ownership as Rahul Gandhi tweeted. Everyone ‘usually’ need someone from another gender to marry (except LGBTQ). So in usual case even women need a man to marry, but here the gender ration is the issue proving number of girls are lesser than boys.

The point was, one should not go on looking for help of others when he/she himself can achieve it.

So he was trying to motivate people from his own state.
