Truth

This video was shot in 1938, the man in the video is BKS Iyenger, not PM Modi who was born in 1950.

We found that this video was earliest uploaded on YouTube in 2006

So we started looking for Iyenger and Yoga and found that he was one of the earliest mast of modern day yoga and have founded an organization recognized and helping people globally.

On his portal we found a DVD on sale which also had a screenshot from the viral video named 1938 Practice
