The girl on the cover is an illustration, whereas the lady in the viral post is Infosys chairperson Sudha Murthy.

THE PROBE

To check the claim, we did a reverse search and found that the woman in the viral photo is not Neeru Deshpande but Infosys chairperson Sudha Murthy. We found her photo on the blog of Mehta Publishing House with some other photographs of the event.

The photo was clicked in January, 2013 when Murthy visited the office of the publishing house. One can also see her photograph on the website of Infosys.

WHO IS PARLE-G GIRL?

The kid on the Parle-G biscuit cover is just an illustration.

The speculations about the kid are not new. Neeru Deshpande, Sudha Murthy and Gunjan Gundaniya are a few names that have remained in the centre of these speculations. But, Parle products' group product manager Mayank Shah had denied these stories a few years ago saying that the kid is just an illustration which was made in the 60s by Everest Creative.

Many prominent media houses had published the statement of Shah.

It is clear that the Parle-G girl is actually an illustration and has nothing to do with Infosys chairperson Sudha Murthy.
