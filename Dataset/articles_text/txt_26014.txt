Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann is married to Dr Gurpreet Kaur. Many guests including Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal attended Mann’s wedding. Many pictures of Bhagwant Mann’s wedding are becoming viral on social media. At the same time, a photo of Arvind Kejriwal is also going viral. It can be seen in this photo that Kejriwal is eating food while sitting on the ground.

Users sharing this photo are claiming that at Mann’s wedding, Kejriwal was served langar by sitting on the ground. One user wrote- “Picture direct from Bhagwant Maan ji’s marriage”

While sharing this photo, another user wrote – “Photo direct from Bhagwant Mann ji’s wedding….. CM of Delhi tasting langar at Punjab CM’s wedding”

Fact Check:

To check the veracity of the photo going viral, we did a reverse image search of the picture. During this, we found this picture posted on the Twitter handle of the Aam Aadmi Party. Aam Aadmi Party posted this picture on 3 April 2018. According to this post, Arvind Kejriwal had gone to the Bhandara organized by the employees of the Delhi Secretariat. During this, he ate langar sitting on the ground like a common man, bypassing the VIP culture.
