Amidst the ongoing nationwide protests over the contentious ‘Agnipath’ scheme, video of a burning train is being shared online, claiming that the visuals are from Secunderabad in Telangana.

The video is being shared with a caption, “तेलंगाना के सिकंदराबाद में अग्निपथ स्कीम के विरोध में हुई आगजनी की घटना”

(English Translation: Arson incident in Telangana’s Secunderabad against Agnipath scheme)

Here’s the link to the above post.

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the post and found it to be misleading.

We ran a keyword search along with a Reverse Image Search on the keyframes of the video and found that the same video was featured in an NDTV report dated June 17, 2022. As per the report, the video is from Lakhisarai, Bihar.

Mojo Story also uploaded the same video on YouTube on June 17, 2022, with the title, “Agnipath | Trains Set On Fire In Bihar On 3rd Day Of Protest | Over 34 Trains Cancelled By Railways.”

This proves that the video is from Bihar and not Telangana.

However, we did find reports of Secunderabad Railway Station being vandalised and that of a train being set ablaze by agitators in Telangana.
