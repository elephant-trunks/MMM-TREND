A post is getting viral on social media with a claim that the central government has imposed tax on school books.

Many social media users are sharing the claim.

Fact Check:-

To investigate the viral claim DFRAC team run a search on google using the keywords and found a report on hindubusinessline.com, according to their report there is no GST on books, but prices may tend to rise.

We found more reports on this on different websites we found, while there is no exact mention of GST on school books or textbooks, GST on ‘Printed books, including Braille books’; and on ‘Children’s picture, drawing or colouring books’ is zero, whereas the GST on ‘Exercise book, graph book, & laboratory note book and notebooks’ is 12%. The Authority of Advance Ruling (AAR) held that 12% of GST is applicable to printing and supply of textbooks to government departments which are registered under Goods and Services Tax (GST) Acts, 2017.

Conclusion:-

Hence, our factcheck proves that there is no tax on printed school books, there is tax on their printing and supply.
