Next we searched for similar videos published in 2017 on Youtube which led us to a similar clip published by L’Express’s official Youtube account with the title which when translated from French reads , “Emmanuel Macron receives an egg at the Agricultural Show”. We can spot Macron being hit on the head with an egg. At the 23 seconds timestamp an egg can be seen spattered over Macron’s face, however, this video has been shot from a distance and the mike hanging above can be seen in the viral clip.

You can also view the same incident from a different angle which was uploaded by Ruptly on their official Youtube channel on 1st March 2017 with the description as “French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron was hit by an egg on the head as he attended the annual Paris Agricultural Fair (Salon de l’Agriculture)”

Fact Crescendo has previously debunked misinformation after the killing of the French teacher in Paris as unrelated videos and images have been shared with false claims.

The French president’s recent remarks defending free speech has triggered a wave of misinfo on social media.

Conclusion- Fact Crescendo found the viral video to be False. The incident of the French President Macron being egged as shown in the post took place in 2017 when he attended a farm fair as part of his Presidential campaign. The video has no relation with the ongoing outrage in France after Macron’s comment on Islam.
