Fact Check–

We started our investigation by carefully observing the video where we found that “America’s Corp Band” written on a bus. We ran a reverse image search on the same and found this video on YouTube uploaded on 19th September 2019. It means that this video is not a recent one shot on 74th Independence Day in India.

Another keyword search led us to same video published by ANI on 19th September 2019 stating that the American Army band playing Indian National Anthem during the Exercise Yudh Abhyas 2019 at Joint Base Lewis, McChord.
