A senior DMK leader responds to a fiery speech by an actor-turned-politician in Erode. The speaker dismisses the actor's political ambitions, stating the actor is 'not interested in the people or welfare of Tamil Nadu' and only wants to become Chief Minister. Drawing parallels with historical figures, the leader argues that while some actors succeeded after years of party work, others failed despite their popularity. The speaker suggests the actor's move to politics is because 'movie chances are getting low' and treats it as 'another business.' The interview also touches on ideological comparisons with Dravidian icons and the actor's criticism of the ruling party. The leader questions the actor's contribution to Tamil culture and challenges the actor to agitate for the people's cause.
