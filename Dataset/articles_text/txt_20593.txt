Fact Check

After cross-checking the story behind the video. We found the video was highly misled by the users on social media. The video is 10 years old and the incident took place in Kapurthala District of Punjab. Few teachers went on the top of the water tank of Kapurthala District Hospital and demanded to meet the education minister of Punjab, Upinderjit Kaur. Unfortunately, the minister didn’t show up and in return two of them burned themselves. The fiery outburst was covered by Sikh Revolution on YouTube. Hence proving the claim is misleading.
