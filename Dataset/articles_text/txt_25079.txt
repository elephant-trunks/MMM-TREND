“Medical apathy! Man awaits ambulance while carrying mother’s oxygen cylinders on shoulder

Agra (UP), Apr 07 (ANI): In yet another case of medical apathy, a man was allegedly made to wait for an ambulance at Uttar Pradesh’s Agra Medical College, while carrying oxygen cylinder attached to his ailing mother, on his shoulder. A video of the medical apathy went viral where the woman was seen standing in the hospital premises with her oxygen mask on, while her son was standing next to her holding her oxygen tank. The mother-son duo waited for a long time for the ambulance, but the vehicle was a no-show. However, hospital authorities denied the allegation while assuring action in the matter.“
