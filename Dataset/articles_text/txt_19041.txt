BOOM found a report on Times of India on February 13, 2020 which stated that the video of birds flocking together was shot by residents of Ahmedabad. Taking cue from a post by a Facebook user, we found that the video was shot by Chirag Thumar, a digital marketing professional based in Gujarat. On February 11, 2020 Thumar tweeted the 45 second long video. BOOM reached out to Thumar who confirmed to us that he had shot the video. BOOM had debunked the video earlier on March 31, 2020, when it was falsely linked to COVID-19 lockdown and the subsequent movement of wildlife in human habitats.
