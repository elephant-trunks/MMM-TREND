In his address to the nation on April 3, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed Indians to light lamps and candles, or use even mobile phone flashlights on Sunday to mark the fight against coronavirus and "defeat the darkness spread by the Covid-19 pandemic".

Now, a video is circulating on social media with the claim that this speech of PM Modi was broadcast on TV channels in Brazil, following which on April 4, Brazilians observed his "lights out" call. The viral video shows people on the streets with their mobile phone flashlights on and playing music.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading. The video has been on the Internet even before PM Modi's April 3 speech.

The claim in Hindi along with the video translates to, "Television channels in Brazil broadcast PM Modi's address. And this is what Brazilians did." The archived version can be seen here. The video has gone viral on Facebook with the wrong claim.

AFWA investigation

With the help of reverse search, we found a Brazilian user named "Janielly Araujo" had uploaded the video on March 25. Till the filing of this story, the video has been shared more than 86,000 times.

Google translates the caption in Portuguese to, "It was beautiful! All honor and all glory be given to him!" We could not verify where and when exactly the video was shot and its purpose. But it is clear that the video has nothing to do with PM Modi's appeal of "lights out".
