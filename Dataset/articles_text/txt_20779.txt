A video that has gone viral on Facebook claiming that the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya is collapsing into a river. Users have posted the same video multiple times in Bangla language.

It must be noted that the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya is still under construction at this moment. The video is being posted perhaps due to the ongoing communal violence in North Eastern India and Bangladesh.

Fact-Check:

However, after performing a reverse image search on the the video, we found that the video was posted in October,2019 and is captioned ”Real video of Mathurapur, Malda”. Taking a cue from this title, we then found news reports on the incident confirming that a temple in Malda, West Bengal collapsed.

Since the video is not from Ayodhya and is definitely old, this claim is misleading.
