An image showing a sea of crowd claimed to have been taken at the rally held by All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) Chief Asaduddin Owaisi, in Uttar Pradesh as part of his election campaign in the state. The reports confirmed that the campaign was held in western UP’s Sambhal, where he had addressed a rally on July 15.

The image has been shared with a caption in Hindi which translates as: “Only Owaisi In UP” #यूपी_में_ओवैसी and posted on July 15, 2021.

Fact Check

A Google reverse image search threw up results showing a similar image tweeted by a user on November 10, 2019 with a caption that read: “World Biggest Jasne Juluse Eid E Milad-Un-Nabi Chittagong in Bangladesh. Leading by Awlad e Rasul Hozur Allama Tahir Shah (M.J.A) Smiling face with heart-shaped eyes #Mawlid #Mawlid2019 #MiladUnNabi #EideMilad #EiDeMiladunNabi #MawlidunNabi.”

Taking cue from the above tweet, when we searched Google for relevant news, we found a video uploaded on YouTube on November 11, 2019. The description said that it was related to a huge procession of Eid celebrations in Chittagong, Bangladesh. The message read:”Historical Jashne Juluse EID-E MILADUNNABI at Muradpur in Chattogram, Bangladesh.”

The image can be seen in the video from 0:02 to 1:59, when the vehicle was moving. The news was confirmed in local media on November 10, 2019 about the procession that was held in Chittagong, Bangladesh on the occasion of Eid E Milad-Un-Nabi, birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad.

Claim: Massive crowds at AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi’s election rally on July 15, 2021.

Conclusion: The image showing massive crowds belonged to the procession that was held in Chittagong, Bangladesh on Nov. 10, 2019 on Eid E Milad-Un-Nabi, birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad and NOT that of Owaisi’s election rally in UP.
