Only 35% people received medical attention from qualified medical personnel before dying, according to the government’s Sample Registration Survey (SRS) report, 2015.

While 27% received medical attention at government hospitals, 17% received attention at private hospitals.

As many as 21% people received attention from an untrained person before dying, the data show.

The method of recording medical attention received before death was modified since 2004 to capture deaths that occur specifically at private hospitals and nursing homes.

Among larger Indian states, Himachal Pradesh (51%) reported the highest proportion of deaths in government hospitals and Jharkhand (18%) the lowest.

Kerala (35%) reported the highest proportion of deaths in private hospitals; the lowest was West Bengal (10%).

Odisha (41%) reported the highest percentage of deaths attended by an untrained functionary while Punjab (1.4%) had the lowest.

Haryana (52%) had the highest percentage of deaths attended by qualified professional while Odisha (15%) had the least.

Public-health centres across India’s rural areas–25,308 in 29 states and seven union territories–are short of more than 3,000 doctors, the scarcity rising 200% (or tripling) over 10 years, IndiaSpend reported in February 2016.
