A disturbing image of bodies of soldiers lined up on the ground is circulating on Facebook with the claim that these were the Indian jawans martyred in the stand-off against Chinese troops in Galwan Valley of eastern Ladakh.

Several Facebook users have posted the image with the caption, “Pic From #Ladakh Indian Army”. Some other users have written: PM Narendra Modi says “Our soldiers’ sacrifices won’t go to waste” after Ladakh face-off.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral image is not of Indian soldiers martyred in the recent clash with China in Ladakh. The picture is at least five years old and of Nigerian soldiers killed reportedly by Boko Haram insurgents.

The archived versions of the posts can be seen here and here. The post has gone viral on Facebook.

With the help of reverse image search, we found that the picture has been viral on the Internet since 2015. Some had tweeted the image and some others had written blogs in 2015, claiming that these are the bodies of 105 missing Nigerian soldiers who were killed by Boko Haram insurgents.

Later, this image was used in several news reports too.

As per these news reports, controversy erupted in Nigeria in 2015 over 105 missing soldiers. All of a sudden, images of bodies of Nigerian soldiers surfaced on social media. People blamed the government for hiding the fact that these soldiers were killed allegedly by Boko Haram, a jihadis terror group based in northeastern Nigeria, and also active in Chad, Niger and northern Cameroon.

Hence, the viral image has nothing to do with the current border crisis between India and China.
