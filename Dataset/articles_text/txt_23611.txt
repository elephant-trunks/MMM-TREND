As many as 70% women said they did not report sexual harassment by superiors because they feared the repercussions, according to a survey conducted by the Indian Bar Association in 2017, IndiaSpend reported on March 4, 2017.

“Low or no reporting speaks volumes about the gender sensitivity of a particular organisation,” Anagha Sarpotdar, a researcher working on sexual harassment at workplace, had told IndiaSpend.

“Women may not know where to go to report harassment or it could be that the cases may not have been dealt with sincerely. Often, women go to committees believing them to be independent, and find that they are actually puppets in the hands of their superiors.”

The government has set-up an online complaint management system--Sexual Harassment electronic–Box (SHe-Box)--under the ministry of women and child development for registering sexual harassment complaints at workplace, Virendra Kumar, minister of state, ministry of women and child development, told the Parliament in his reply on December 15, 2017.
