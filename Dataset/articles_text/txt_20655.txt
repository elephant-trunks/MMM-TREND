Cable News Network (CNN) is a multinational news-based pay television channel headquartered in Atlanta, United States. A picture is going viral of CNN’s coverage of a mass firing at King Snooper supermarket in Boulder, Colorado United States where a man shooted 10 people on the spot. Users on Twitter are posting the picture whose headline states that the shooter was factually Arabic but morally white. People are cribbing about the headline on social media platforms.

Fact check

After looking at the picture we were sure there was something black in the dish, therefore we examined the viral picture of CNN and got to know that header was edited through Photoshop. As in the original, you cannot find the viral headline. After digging more, we found that the video was uploaded on YouTube on 24th March 2021 by CNN.

Hence proving the claim is fake and misleading.
