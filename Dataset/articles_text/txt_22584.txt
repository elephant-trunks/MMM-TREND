India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the post to be misleading. Though we could not verify the authenticity of the incident, but Gates is certainly not the son of a woodcutter.

The archived version of the post can be seen here. Several Facebook users have made the same claim believing it to be a true inspirational story from the life of the Microsoft founder.

According to his biography in his blog 'GatesNotes', his father was an attorney.

The bio says, "His dad, William H. Gates II, is a Seattle attorney and one of the co-chairs of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. His late mother, Mary Gates, was a schoolteacher, University of Washington regent, and chairwoman of United Way International."
