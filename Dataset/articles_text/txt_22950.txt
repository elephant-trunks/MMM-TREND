ENGLISH TRANSLATION: Brother of Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath runs a tea stall.

India Today Fact Check found that the man in the viral photo is not the brother of CM Yogi Adityanath. This photo has been already shared by more than 11,000 people at the time of filing this story.

For the verification of the image, India Today reached out to Yogi's sister Shashi Singh. On the behalf of Shashi, her husband Puran Payal told us that the man in the photo is neither the brother of Yogi nor any family member. He also confirmed that none of Yogi's brother runs a tea shop. Yogi has three brothers and three sisters.

When we searched about the family of Yogi Adityanath, we found a family interview done by ABP News back in March, 2017, when Yogi was elected the CM of Uttar Pradesh. Two of his brothers can be seen in this interview, whereas his third brother is working in Indian Army.

Many prominent media houses had reported the story of Shailendra Mohan including India Today. It can be clearly seen that the photo of the man in the viral post doesn't match with any of Yogi's brother.

We couldn't find the identity of the man in the photo but it is established that he is not the brother of CM Yogi Adityanath. However, the man in the photo has a striking resemblance with CM Yogi.
