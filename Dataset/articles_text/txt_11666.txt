As the world is left stunned with the ongoing Russian attack of Ukraine, social media is seeing a concoction of unrelated videos, gaming footage and CGI animation, mixed with genuine content, making it difficult for online users to tell apart fake videos from the real ones. One such video, that was shared during the initial hours of the breakout of the war, showed a quiet residential complex during the dark hours, being lit up by flashes of bright light and deafening sound. Posts accompanying the video claim that it shows Russian forces bombing the Southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Newschecker has found this claim to be false.

Fact check/Verification

To check the veracity of the claim, Newschecker analysed the video and found that the loud deafening boom was eerily similar to a thunder strike. We scanned through the comment section of one of the posts and found a user pointing out that the video did not show the Russian invasion in Ukraine, but instead it showed a thunderstorm.

Using this as a clue, we split the video into keyframes and conducted a reverse image search online, with the key words “lightning” and “thunderstorm”. We soon found a tweet that shared the link of a TikTok video, claiming that ‘This video was posted weeks ago on Tiktok and is NOT showing a military attack’. The user also shared a link to the TikTok video.
