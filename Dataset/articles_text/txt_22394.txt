With over 8,000 deaths, Italy has recorded the most number of casualties in the world due to Covid-19. Amid this, a quote attributed to Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has gone viral on social media. According to the viral post, Italian PM Giuseppe Conte said the country has surrendered to the Covid-19 pandemic as all the reliefs have been exhausted.

The statement attributed to Italian PM Giuseppe Conte reads: "Our control is gone. Infectious disease is killing us. All the possible relief on the earth is over."

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the viral post to be fake. The quote is made up as we couldn't find any credible news report saying that Italian PM has given such a statement over Covid- 19 deaths. Even the picture used in the viral post is not of Italian PM Conte but President of Italy Sergio Mattarella.

We also scanned the social media profiles of Italian PM, but couldn't find any such statement given by him.

A website -- Rappler -- also debunked the viral post.

Contrary to the viral post, the report of Rappler says that on March 21, Italian PM said: "We are giving up the most expensive habits, we do it because we love Italy, but we do not give up courage and hope in the future. United we will do it".
