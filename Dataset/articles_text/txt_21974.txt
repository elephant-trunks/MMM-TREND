An image of a man with a noose around his neck tied to a crane, smiling and waving, has gone viral on Facebook with the claim that he was hanged to death in Syria because he was a Christian.

Several Facebook users have posted this haunting image with the caption, “He was sentenced to death in Syria because of his faith in Christ. Reports say he was smiling as on his way to be hung because of his extreme faith in God. Its time for us to step up and share the Gospel of our Lord & Saviour.”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The man in the picture was Majid Kavousifar. He, along with his nephew, was executed in Tehran, Iran, in 2007 for killing a judge.

The archived versions of the posts can be seen here and here.

Using a reverse image search, we found several international news reports from 2007, carrying similar pictures of the same man with the blue noose around his neck.

As per these news reports, Majid and his nephew Hossein were convicted of murdering an Iranian judge and publicly hanged from cranes in Tehran’s Ershad Judiciary Complex on August 2, 2007. The man seen in the picture is Majid.

As per the BBC, the execution was carried out at the same location as the murder, and on the same date, in front of a huge picture of the murdered judge. When Hossein looked distressed as he awaited his execution, Majid gestured towards him and smiled in an attempt to reassure him.

According to these news reports, in 2005, the two men had shot dead Hassan Moghaddas, a judge handling sensitive cases such as “moral corruption”.

Earlier, India Today had debunked misleading claims with other similar photos of the incident linking them to the execution of an Algerian hacker.

Hence, it is confirmed that the viral Facebook claim saying the man in the viral photo was executed in Syria for being a Christian is not true.
