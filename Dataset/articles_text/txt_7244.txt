An image of letterhead in the name ‘Sir Ganga Ram hospital’ in Delhi, mentioning the medication to be taken to prevent the risk of being infected from COVID-19 is being shared on social media. The letter also states that, as per the ICMR guidelines, the contacts of COVID-19 positive cases would be put on ‘home isolation’ even if they have mild symptoms. But, ‘Sir Ganga Ram hospital’ has clarified that the image being shared as that issued on behalf of the hospital is fake, and that someone had forged the doctor’s signature. The hospital said it dissociates itself from such fake messages.
