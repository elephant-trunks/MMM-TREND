In the past few weeks, an image of the CID department of Kolkata is going viral on social media.

Users are posting a picture of a very dilapidated building that looks to be really old as well. Users are ridiculing this picture and taking digs at CM Mamata Banerjee for the condition of the building.

Fact-Check:

However, when we were looking through the claims to find more like them, we came across the same post but from 2018.

Additionally, we found India Today’s report on the topic and they actually spoke to the person in charge and realised that the office had moved to a new building in 2018 itself. They even went to the new office to film the footage.

Therefore, this claim is misleading.
