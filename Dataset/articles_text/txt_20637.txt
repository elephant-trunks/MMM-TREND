The ruling party Congress is working hard for the Punjab Assembly elections. Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched the election campaign in Punjab and participated in a virtual rally in Jalandhar on Thursday. During this, Rahul Gandhi visited Amritsar where he paid his obeisance at Harmandir Sahib. Where after Rahul Gandhi also ate langar. Along with Rahul Gandhi, there were many workers including Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi and Punjab Congress President Navjot Singh Sidhu.

While sharing a video of Rahul Gandhi, Bharatiya Janata Party leader Sambit Patra has made fun of Rahul Gandhi. Actually, this video is from the time of Rahul Gandhi eating langar in Harmandir Sahib. In this video posted by news agency ANI, Rahul Gandhi is seen wearing a mask. Sambit Patra tweeted “wearing a mask and having langar , this could be only the 8th wonder.”

मास्क पहन कर लंगर? ये तो आठवां अजूबा ही हो सकता है! https://t.co/ugYOdenALE — Sambit Patra (Modi Ka Parivar) (@sambitswaraj) January 27, 2022

Fact Check

The viral video posted by Sambit Patra and its claim was investigated. On investigation, we found that this video was posted by news agency ANI. However, at the time when the video was posted, Rahul Gandhi had already eaten the langar. On the other hand, a video has been posted by Rahul Gandhi’s official Twitter account. In which Rahul Gandhi can be clearly seen eating langar.

The photo of eating the same langar has also been published on Dainik Bhaskar’s web portal. Which has been captioned- “Langar Chhakte Rahul Gandhi with CM Charanjit Channi at Sri Darbar Sahib”

According to the page of Wikipedia, Harmandir Sahib is called Shri Darbar Sahib or Golden Temple.

Conclusion

BJP leader Sambit Patra’s claim of Rahul Gandhi eating ‘langar’ wearing a mask is misleading. Rahul Gandhi wore a mask before eating langar and immediately after eating langar. But Sambit Patra shared the video making fun of Rahul Gandhi.

Claim review:- Wrong claim by BJP Leader Sambit Patra By sharing video of Rahul Gandhi’s incomplete statement.

Claimed by:- @sambitswaraj (congress leader)

Fact Check: misleading
