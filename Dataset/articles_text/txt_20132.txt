A video is becoming very viral on social media. In which 5 people can be seen floating in the flood waters. It is being claimed that the viral video is from the South Indian state of Telangana.

To check the viral video, DFRAC first converted the video into keyframes with the help of Invoke tool. After doing a reverse search image of the keyframe, our team found a video on YouTube in this regard. The viral video was uploaded on YouTube with the title “Patalpani incident Indoree”. The video can be viewed below.

Apart from this, we did some keyword searches on Google to get more information related to the video. During this, we got a report from NDTV. It was told that this incident came to the fore in Indore in 2011. Due to the flood caused by rain in Patalpani, five members of the same family who had come for a picnic were washed away in the flood.

Conclusion

Hence the viral video is misleading.
