“भोपाल मे सडको पर डरे हुए शांतिदूत @ RSSorg के खिलाफ हाथो मे गंडासे और तलवारें ले के निकले है… इसमे एक अंतराष्ट्रीय षडयंत्र नजर आता है कि किसी भी तरह देश मे भय का वातावरण बने और विश्वमंच पक मोदीजी और भारत को बदनाम किया जा सके @ chshekharbjp @ rammadhavbjp @ narendramodi @ TarekFatah”

This Hindu-hate is enabled by the "secular" brigade which normalizes and spreads this. All the way from @RahulGandhi's letter. https://t.co/ArY9A4dSQy — Sankrant Sanu सानु (@sankrant) July 4, 2019

Truth

Yes, a mob with swords in hands makes one afraid, very afraid, and it’s strange how such huge numbers of lethal weapon is allowed in public as anything can go wrong in seconds ending in taking lives but this was a celebration.

The video is 2 years old, i.e. 2017. It’s celebration of Moharram in Dehri On Sone, Bihar, not recent from Bhopal as virally claimed.

This was uploaded on YouTube two years ago Nov 2017 claimed as of Moharram celebration in Dehri On Sone, Bihar.

Below is the same video but of high resolution in which the audio is different. The announcer is asking people to proceed slowly “Dheere Dheere Badhte Rahiye”



You can see a comparison of both videos (viral now, and old one) below

You can see video but much longer i.e. 2 minutes + of the same celebration but from different camera/mobile of high resolution which clears the location. I’ts Barah Patthar, an area in Dehri On Sone, Bihar

The viral video has a board of Sudama Restaurant. it’s also in the long video next to which is a sign board “Barah Patthar”

Sudama Restaurant in the viral video –



Same restaurant in the longer video, with Barah Patthar Sign board
