Some days back, a heart-wrenching video of a toddler trying to wake his dead mother left the Internet in grief and came to symbolise the migrant crisis in the backdrop of the nationwide coronavirus lockdown. The woman’s body was lying unattended at Muzaffarpur railway station in Bihar.

More recently, a picture of another toddler latching on to an injured woman lying on the ground and breastfeeding is going viral. The claim says the woman was lying dead on the railway tracks in Damoh, Madhya Pradesh, and the toddler, unaware of that, was trying to feed himself.

Netizens are sharing this post believing it to be another case of the plight of migrant workers in India amid the Covid-19 outbreak.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the incident did take place in Damoh but in 2017.

The caption along with the viral image says, “#AtmaNirbharBharat Infant. #Woman lay dead by railway tracks in MP's Damoh, infant son tries to breastfeed. #MigrantsLivesMatter #MigrantWorkers #MODI#MigrantsOnTheRoad #PMCares #India #CoronaVirus #COVID #CoronaVirusTruth#CoronaVillains”. The archived version can be seen here.

Many Facebook users have shared the three-year-old incident assuming it to be a recent one.

While sharing the image, netizens are also referring to an article by “India Today”, which gives complete details about the incident. The article itself reveals the truth, for it was published on May 25, 2017. At that time, many videos and images of the incident had surfaced on the Internet.

The cause of the woman’s death was not known, but according to reports, police suspected she may have fallen off a train or hit by one and died. The incident was also covered by “NDTV” and “Hindustan Times”.

Therefore, it is clear that a three-year-old image has been passed off as a recent one in the light of the migrant crisis in the country. It is, however, a fact that migrants have borne the brunt of the lockdown, many walking hundreds on kilometres on foot, to reach their homes as most industries had shut.
