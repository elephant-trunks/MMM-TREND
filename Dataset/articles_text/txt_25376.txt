Spread the truth:

Politics, as we know in India, is powerful. A Former IPS Officer Yogesh Pratap Singh tried to portray the relations of Police and Politics in his movie “Kya Yahi Sach Hai” released on 30th Dec 2011.

For last few years a a photo from the movie is viral on Social Media, few even claims it to be from real life.

But yesterday, a congress supporter Twitter Handle @faridapatel went a step further, morphed Photo of Home Minister Rajnath Singh from BJP on the face of actor playing minister in this photo.

“केन्द्रीय गृहमंत्रालयमे वरिष्ठ पुलिस अफसर के साथ होता है ये सुलूक..”

Quoted by Sanjay Jha –

If this is a true picture, it is just too much. Stunned beyond comprehension. https://t.co/mSl4RMdp4O — Sanjay Jha (@JhaSanjay) November 1, 2017

@zurohit queried if it’s genuine or not.

@SMHoaxSlayer please tell if this pic is genuine https://t.co/QSKJmNedQf — Man of Times (@zurohit) October 12, 2017

SMHoaxSlayer Tweeted claiming it to be wrong, when fake tweets were hardly 30, but had great potential to spread which actually ended up crossing up 100 retweets, but later @faridapatel deleted the tweet

#Photoshop This is from a Movie "Kya Yahi Sach hai" directed by an IPS.

Rajnath Singh ji's fa e has been photoshopped. Tweet saved. https://t.co/TvZP0MSqpw — SM Hoax Slayer (@SMHoaxSlayer) October 12, 2017

But her tweet is saved and you can see it by clicking here

And later on being caught, the handle @faridapatel ultimately blocked SMHoaxSlayer
