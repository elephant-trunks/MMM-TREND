Here are the false claims made by Modi during 2017:

December 31, 2016: The Prime Minister tweeted about a new scheme to boost maternal and child health by transferring Rs 6,000 directly to the bank accounts of pregnant women who undergo institutional deliveries/ and vaccinate their children.

False because the provision of providing Rs 6,000 to pregnant women already existed under the National Food Security Act, 2013.

February 5, 2017: UP is “number 1” in crime, with 24 rapes, 21 attempts to rape, 13 murders, 33 kidnappings, 19 riots and 136 thefts every day.

False because UP was ranked 22nd for murder, 20th for kidnapping, 28th for rape, 17th for riots, and 19th for thefts out of 36 states and union territories, according to data from the National Crime Records Bureau for 2015.

February 16, 2017: If there is a region in India where crimes against lower castes are the highest, it is Uttar Pradesh.

False because Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, had higher crime rates in 2015.

February 16, 2017: We started such a crop insurance scheme--named Prime Ministers’ Crop Insurance Scheme--where, even if natural reasons affect the crop at sowing, the farmer will be insured. Has anybody seen such a scheme before?

False because an earlier insurance scheme had a sub-scheme named Weather-Based Crop Insurance Scheme, which was limited to some geographical regions but insured crops against drought, excess rains and even frost.

October 22, 2017: This (Gujarat ro-ro ferry) may be a project between Ghogha and Dahej, but it is a landmark project not only for India but also for entire South East Asia. The ferry service is a first of sorts.

False because larger ro-ro ferries have been in operation across Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, China and South Korea for several years.

November 30, 2017: Aadhaar has helped weed crores of fictitious beneficiaries.

False because 74,000 unique consumer identities for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) subsidy were linked to only 37,000 Aadhaar numbers as of August 2015, and 960,000 ineligible consumers received Rs 49.21 crore subsidy under the Direct Benefits Transfer for LPG, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General.

November 30, 2017: In the last three years of the previous government, capital expenditure was about Rs 1.49 lakh crore. Under this government’s three years, capital expenditure was about Rs 2.64 lakh crore.

False because capital expenditure under the Modi government’s three years was Rs 6.9 lakh crore as against Rs 5.15 lakh crore under the Manmohan Singh government’s last three years.

November 30, 2017: Big and sustainable changes do not develop on their own, they require systemic overhaul. It is because of such an overhaul that the country moved from 142 to 100 on the Ease of Doing Business ranking.

False because while India did move up 42 places to 100 from 142, the ranks are not comparable because of frequent revisions in parameters.
