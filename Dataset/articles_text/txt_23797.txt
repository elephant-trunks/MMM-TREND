The view seem to have gained additional ground ever since the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) released its latest update on crime records in the country.

But is this true or do we need to see these numbers in proportion to the population of each city.

We decided to do a FactCheck on these numbers and put them in perspective. According to our analysis, data from the NCRB shows that among the top cities, the dubious distinction of being the most unsafe city goes to Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh while Jabalpur/Delhi now rank in second place.

Gwalior has reported 22.8 rape cases for every 100,000 women in the city, which is an increase of 95 percent from 2012.

Second place seems to be a tie between Delhi and Jabalpur with both reporting rape cases of 19.02 for every 100,000 women in the city. On a standalone basis, Delhi does have the highest number of reported rape cases at 1,441, which have increased by 146 percent in 2013, compared to last year's numbers which stood at 585 cases reported.

It is most likely that there are huge distortions being causes by cases that are being reported in some cities and not in others. Unfortunately, there are only sample studies that provide indicators of what the variance could be.

The all-India average numbers have also increased to 6.39 rape cases per 100,000 women compared to 4 cases per 100,000 women population last year. Among the 53 cities whose crime nos have been given by NCRB, 22 cities had a more than higher average.
