In the video, he says,“Hindu marriage is not legal in Pakistan. I was just surprised that there is such a law.” See the video and the wording is from 8 minutes onwards:

Fact Check:

Our search on Google threw up results which said that the claim was not true as in 2017, Hindu marriages are made legal in Pakistan as per the Hindu Marriage Act 2017. The Hindu Marriage Bill 2017 was signed by the then Pakistan President Mamnoon Hussain on March 2017. See the archived version of the Act here.

Under this Act, Hindus, a minority in Pakistan, can marry according to their customs and rituals in Pakistan. It came into being three years after the Ministry of Human Rights mooted the draft. The news was carried by many media houses including BBC, The Hindu and India Today.

Conclusion: Since the Hindu Marriage Act is very much there in Pakistan, what Sadhguru said in his video was Misinterpretation and our rating is ??.
