As we have written previously, fake news and misleading information is being peddled by everyone as the UP elections are coming closer. A promotional poster regarding the construction of a dam in Bundelkhand is being posted by several prominent BJP leaders.

The posts claim that a dam is being constructed in Bundelkhand by Yogi Adityanath’s government to show progress.

Bundelkhand which was traditionally used by politicians for their personal benefits is today witnessing a sea of change. #बुलन्द_बुन्देलखण्ड https://t.co/rddId0NV5n — Dr Avadhesh Singh (@DrAvadheshBJP) November 19, 2021

Fact-Check:

Upon performing a reverse image search on the picture of the dam, we found that the picture was first used in an article by the Deccan Herald in 2014. The article was written about the new Srisailam Dam that was constructed in on the Krishna River in Andhra Pradesh.

The image is definitely old and not representative of the dam being constructed in Bundelkhand.

Therefore, this claim is misleading.
