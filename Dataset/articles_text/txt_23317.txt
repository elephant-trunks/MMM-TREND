Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, in a speech addressing UP Investors Summit in Lucknow on June 3, 2022, claimed that since the BJP government came into power in the state in 2017 the unemployment rate had fallen from 18% to 2.9%. He attributed the drop to the implementation of the Industrial Investment and Employment Promotion Policy.



While claiming that the UP government provided jobs to lakhs of youngsters, Adityanath said, "Aaj Uttar Pradesh mein, jo unemployment rate hai vo 18% se ghatkar 2.9% reh gai hai." This translates to "Today in Uttar Pradesh the unemployment rate has reduced from 18% to 2.9% now."

Fact-check The unemployment rate never crossed double digits in 2017, according to data published by the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent think tank that publishes monthly and quarterly data bulletins on employment in India. While the unemployment rate in the state did touch 18% under the Akhilesh Yadav government, it was in June 2016, nine months before the Yogi government came into power. The rate quickly recovered and reduced to 2.4% in March 2017 when Adityanath was sworn in as CM. In fact, during the pandemic and when the country was under lockdown, the state's unemployment rate rose to its recent highest of 21.5% in April 2020.
