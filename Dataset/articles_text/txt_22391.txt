Since the outbreak of coronavirus that has so far led to over 27,000 deaths and infected almost 6 lakh globally, social media is full of bizarre treatments. The latest home remedy going viral on Internet suggests inhaling the steam of sea salt and orange peelings to prevent Covid-19.

Facebook user "Linwood Waller" posted a photo of orange skin steaming in water and claimed, "Steam Sea Salt and Orange peelings. Inhale the steam for 15mins. It Suppose to Prevent Corona Virus from entering the body. Seen it on social media and yes I'm doing it."

Other Facebook users such as "Deidrea Mcfadden" went on to advise, "CVR TREATMENT! BOIL ORANGE PEELINGS, SPRINKLE A LIL SEA SALT.... INHALE THE STEAM FOR 15MINS.... DO THIS EACH TIME U COME BACK IN THE HOUSE! #CVR CAN'T GROW THRU HEAT! BE BLESSED FAMILY!"

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. There is no remedy for Covid-19 as yet and the claim posted by social media users has no scientific proof.

The post is viral on Facebook. "Lawrence Knighton" posted a video showing how to prepare the mixture and inhale it. The video was watched almost 10,000 times. Here is the archived version of the post.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) does not recommend any such remedy to prevent the novel coronavirus infection. The WHO specifically points out, "To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)."

Here is a candid guideline from WHO as to how to take certain precautions against Covid-19 though.

AFWA had earlier debunked similar home remedies that coronavirus can be prevented by gargling, by a hairdryer, or by taking a hot bath.

Similarly, there is no scientific proof that inhaling the steam of sea salt and orange peelings can prevent you from getting infected by the deadly coronavirus.
