Yashwant Sinha, who was a cabinet minister under former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, joined the Trinamool Congress on Saturday, March 13. Sinha, who quit the BJP in 2018, has been a vocal critic of the Narendra Modi-led dispensation for long.

On social media, a screenshot of an apparent tweet by the 83-year-old politician has gone viral. The “tweet” in the form of a rhyme says India has deteriorated since BJP came to power.

Several Facebook users have posted the alleged screenshot of the tweet from the handle “@YashwantSinhaa”. The Hindi text translates to, “Love can spoil a son, and gifts can spoil women. A servant can be spoiled by greed, and friendships ruined by betrayal, farmers by demonetisation and businessmen by GST. Voting for BJP has damaged India. This has been issued in public interest. Thank you.”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the screenshot is morphed. Neither has Sinha tweeted any such rhyme nor does the apparent Twitter handle belong to him.

The archived versions of the posts are saved here and here .

We found that the official Twitter handle of Yashwant Sinha is “@YashwantSinha.” In fact, there is no existence of the Twitter handle “@Yashwant Sinhaa”. With the help of “Advanced Twitter Search”, we could not find that Sinha ever tweeted the same content.

A comparison between a genuine tweet from Sinha’s verified handle and the viral image reveals glaring differences between the two in terms of font and the blue tick.

Searching the Internet we found that the viral rhyme has been available on social media for several years and used many a time with modifications.

Hence, it is confirmed that though Sinha has tweeted critically against the Modi government on several occasions, the viral post has been falsely attributed to him.
