A picture of a bus with images of Dr BR Ambedkar and his wife Savita Ambedkar is circulating on social media with the claim that it was spotted at Columbia in the United States.

The claim in Hindi along with the picture translates to, “Picture of Babasaheb on a city bus running on the streets of Columbia. This is real honour.”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral image is morphed. There is no report from credible sources of a bus in Columbia with an image of Ambedkar and his wife.

The archived versions of similar claims can be seen here, here, here and here.

AFWA probe

Ambedkar is a noted alumnus of Columbia University and his autobiography “Waiting for a Visa” is part of its curriculum.

However, we couldn’t find any credible sources reporting on buses running in Columbia with his picture. With a reverse search of the viral image, we found it is tourist bus in Bath, England.

We found the same picture of the bus uploaded on several websites, but without the images of Ambedkar and his wife.

According to Wikimedia Commons which published the original version of the image, it was clicked by photographer Adrian Pingstone in July 2008. The description of the image says it is a sightseeing bus run for tourists in Bath by an open-top bus service called ‘City Sightseeing’.

Similar images of the same bus can be seen in City Sightseeing’s official website.

We also found the original picture of BR Ambedkar and his wife Savita Ambedkar used in the morphed image. Hence, it is clear that the viral picture of Ambedkar and his wife on the bus is photoshopped.
