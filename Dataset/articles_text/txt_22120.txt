The first batch of five Rafale fighter jets touched down on Ambala airbase on July 29. These jets had taken off from Merignac airbase near Bordeaux in France on July 27 and flew 7,000 km with a single halt in UAE.

Amid this, a video of a jet refuelling mid-air is circulating on social media with the claim that this is one of the Rafale jets en-route India. Several Facebook and Twitter users have posted the video with a caption saying, “Few shots from 30,000 feet! Mid air refuelling of #RafaleJets on their way to #India#rafale”.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The viral video is two years old and not of a Rafale jet. This is the footage of a Brazilian Air Force F-5 fighter jet refuelling a Brazilian Navy A-4 fighter jet mid-air.

The archived versions of the posts can be seen here, here and here.

With the help of InVID and reverse image search, we found that the same clip was tweeted by the Brazilian Air Force on September 28, 2018. The tweet in Portuguese translates to, “Interoperability! F-5 fighter of the Brazilian Air Force carries out refueling in flight on A-4 fighter of the Brazilian Navy!”

It is true that en-route India, the Rafale jets were refuelled mid-air from a French tanker. This was tweeted by the Indian Air Force on July 29, 2020, with pictures of the same.

Hence, it is confirmed that the two-year-old viral video of Brazilian jets refuelling mid-air has nothing to do with the in-flight refuelling of the Rafale jets on their way to India.
