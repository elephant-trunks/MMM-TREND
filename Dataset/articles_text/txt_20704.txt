Fact Check

Meanwhile, in our Fact Check analysis, we found that the claim made by these seemingly religious people is fake and misleading.

So from the above photograph, we can see that Fromer UP chief Minister is wearing black socks, not shoes. Hence , the claims of social media users are false. That is to say, we live in an era where people say anything without any proper pieces of evidence and try to relate them with the sentiments of people.
