What NDTV started as a minor mistake of replacing a dot in a figure, turned things turtle. It all began with NDTV tweeting Narendra Modi’s statement about the number of houses built by the government so far. Attributing the fact to PM, the NDTV tweeted:

“Over 1250 crore houses have been set up. People have celebrated Diwali in their new homes. The houses we make will have water, electricity, gas connections and toilets: PM Modi… Track updates: https://t.co/vF3dW7Rx3P Watch LIVE: https://t.co/hMlRpgrUU6 and NDTV 24×7 pic.twitter.com/gxDn8cBlUf — NDTV (@ndtv) December 16, 2018″

Actually, the PM mentioned 1.3 crore houses and not 1,250 crore houses, which could have easily accommodated the entire population. See the video in the tweet below:

The NDA Government has transformed the housing sector and the beneficiaries are the poor and middle class. Be it urban or rural housing, our track record is exemplary. The numbers are more, the houses are bigger and the era of middlemen is over! pic.twitter.com/Ab3khOouza — PM Narendra Modi FC (@PM_Narendermodi) January 30, 2019



The media outlet, however, quickly corrected the tweet and re-issued it at 2.08 PM the same day.

Over 1.25 crore houses have been constructed. People have celebrated Diwali in their new homes. The houses we make will have water, electricity, gas connections and toilets: PM Modi Track updates: https://t.co/vF3dW7Rx3P pic.twitter.com/muGJxQbEWp — NDTV (@ndtv) December 16, 2018

Conclusion: The fact was tweaked by mistake but the damage is impending on all the readers. Our rating of this claim is ?? Misinterpretation.
