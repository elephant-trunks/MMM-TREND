Following Pakistan's semi-final loss to Australia in the ICC T20 World Cup, Pak all-rounder Hasan Ali was heavily chastised online for dropping a crucial catch by Matthew Wade, allowing Australia's thrilling victory.

In this context, a photo of a house with a broken window began circulating, with the claim that Hasan Ali's house was stoned by enraged cricket fans in Pakistan.

However, India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim is false.
