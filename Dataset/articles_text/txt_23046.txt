The Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Manoj Tiwari claimed that the Delhi government received Rs 36,776 crore from the Centre as budget in 2014, and it got Rs 48,000 crore this year.

This was in response to a tweet by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal who had blamed the BJP government at Centre and MCD for provoking the problems of Delhi.

However, we found that the facts don't not support Tiwari's claim.

India Today Fact Check team found that Rs 36,776 crore and Rs 48,000 crore were not amount allocated by the Centre to the Delhi government in 2014-15 and 2018-19, respectively.

We looked at the the figures of Delhi budget of 2014-15 presented by finance minister Arun Jaitley on July 18 as Delhi was under President rule then.

In 2014-15 budget, the Delhi government had received Rs 325 crore as grant in lieu of share in central taxes.

According to the budget presented by Delhi's finance minister Manish Sisoda on March 22, 2018, Rs 775 crore was allocated by the Centre.

Out of Rs 775 crore, Rs 450 crores was in the form of normal central assistance while Rs 325 crores was shared in central taxes.

When asked about the source of his information regarding his claim, Tiwari said, "Delhi being a Union Territory gets all its funds from the Centre. The Modi government has increased the Capital's budget from Rs 36,000 crore to Rs 48,000 crore, now the AAP government has no excuse not to pay municipal corporations."

The Aam Aadmi Party also released a statement contradicting Tiwari's claims.

From the Delhi budget documents, it is clear that Delhi generates more than 95 per cent of revenue from its sources i.e. taxes and excise duty.

The figures tweeted by Manoj Tiwari are factually incorrect. He seems to be confusing the outlay of the Delhi government budget with the Centre's allocation towards Delhi.

The AAP-led Delhi government and the BJP-led municipal corporations are locked in a bitter fight over funds. The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) workers are on strike since September 11 for non-payment of salaries.

On Wednesday, the Delhi government told the Supreme Court that it will release Rs 500 crore to civic bodies. The Delhi government has often argued that while its contribution to central pool of taxes has increased significantly over the years, it has not received proportionate funding from the Union government.
