FactCheck

BOOM used Google's and Yandex's reverse image searches and using relevant keywords, found that this image predates the events that occurred at Galwan Valley.

This image has existed online since February 2019, when the incidents of Pulwama took place. The Pulwama terrorist attack on February 14, 2019, killed 40 personnel belonging to the Central Reserve Police Force in a suicide attack.

This image was shared as unofficially as the remains of those who were martyred.

Many posts can be traced to late February 2019. The earliest posts, on February 16, 2019, can be traced to Reddit and to some accounts on Twitter.





















BOOM could not ascertain the exact date or incident of the photo but results show that the image is from 2019, before the recent border tensions between India and China at Ladakh.
