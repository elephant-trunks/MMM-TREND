Fact Check

On our fact Check analysis, we got a tweet from the official Twitter of the Himalaya Wellness Company

In the above tweet Himalaya has clarified that in certain countries, halal certification is mandatory. Hence, the halal certification is obtained as per the respective regulations for such countries only. Further, it has also clarified and confirmed that none of the Himalayan products contain meat as alleged on some of the social media platforms, this is factually incorrect. Halal certification does not imply that a product contains animal-derived ingredients.

Moreover, we have also found that many companies in the market sell Halal-certified products but that doesn’t mean that they contain Halal meat. Products of companies like Tata, Reliance and Hindustan Unilever limited are also Halal certified.

Hence, the claim by users is misleading.
