In a significant legal development, the Delhi High Court has suspended the life sentence of former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in the Unnao rape case. The court ruled that Sengar was not a 'public servant' under the specific POCSO sections applied by the lower court. Despite this relief, Sengar remains incarcerated due to a separate 10-year sentence for the custodial death of the survivor's father. Following the verdict, the Unnao rape survivor met Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi, stating, 'He gave me the assurance of justice.' The survivor also staged a protest at India Gate, which was dispersed by police.
