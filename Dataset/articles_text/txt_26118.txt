The untimely death of Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu famously known as Sidhu Moosewala has led the whole world in a state of moaning. People are taking up the internet to show their grief and disappointment on this issue.

The Internet is all flooded with the videos of his funeral and the gathering of a large crowd.

Amid all this, a new video of a large crowd can be seen on the internet. People are claiming it to be the crowd that has gathered in order to give condolences to the famous singer Sidhu Moosewala.

A Facebook user writes, “Rip Sidhu musewala saskar @sidhu_moosewala @sidhu_musewala_fanpage #sidhumoosewala #sidhumoosewalafans #punjabiindustry #punjab #punjabi #punjabisuit #punjqbi #singersongwriter #singer #sidhumoosewalasongs #jatti #jattlife #jattwaad .” Along with the video of a large crowd.

Another user writes, “80% of Jats don’t know what they have lost and what a big star he was.”(Translates Hindi) along with the same video.

Fact Check:

We searched different keyframes of the video to know the reality. We do not found any such video on the funeral of Moosewala.

While futher searching we found the same video on a YouTube channel Aapnusanjali .

The same video was uploaded under the caption, “Antim Yatra Vir Jawan Harish Sinh Parmar | Jaihind | Army | Kheda |.”

This report was also covered by the newspaper under the caption, “last farewell: Tearful farewell to Gujarat’s Veer Harish Singh Parmar, who was martyred in Kashmir.”

Conclusion:

DFRAC through its research found this claim to be misleading. As the crowd was gathered for the funeral of Harish Singh Parmar, who was martyred while fighting terrorists in Kashmir and not of Sidhu Moosewala.

Claim Review: the viral video of the large crowd at the funeral of Sidhu Moosewala.

Claimed by: Social Media Users.

Fact Check: Misleading.
