A video is getting viral on the internet where some people are driving over the holy Flag of India. People are claiming that the video is from Tamil Nadu. Further, sharing the video, a user named Jayesh Patel wrote, “watch this video and forward it as much as you can…if u keep quiet today we will be at a loss…because after 6 months there will be no use to pursue it…move the fingers and forward it now. -Tanjore, Tamil Nadu.”

Similarly, many people have shared this video on their social media handles.

Fact Check

Using InVid tool on the different frames of the video and keyword research, we found a twitter post of 2020. The post is similar to a screenshot of the video. Therefore, this video is an old video.

Furthermore, watching the viral video carefully, we found a shop labelled as Sanam Boutique. Using google maps we found that the location of the shop is in Karachi, Pakistan. Comparing a screenshot of the viral video from a video of YouTube of the streets of Karachi, we found both are similar.
