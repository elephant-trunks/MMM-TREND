Spread the truth:

Yesterday, the Supreme Court Lawyer, Prashant Bhushan tweeted a photo showing Presidential Nominee, Draupadi Murmu standing beside RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat, both with folded hands in front of a Photo of Mother India.

Along with the photo he tweeted – “BJP’s presidential candidate Draupadi Murmu visits Mohan Bhagwat at the RSS headquarters in Nagpur! Is there any doubt that she will just be a rubber stamp and not be able to function independently?“

He deleted his above tweet with an apology (Archived here) on learning the fact and did clarify in another tweet.

It has been brought to my notice that this photo of Smt Murmu with Mr Bhagwat might be morphed. I therefore am deleting it with apologies to Mrs Murmu. https://t.co/QOn5pg5o5D — Prashant Bhushan (@pbhushan1) July 5, 2022
