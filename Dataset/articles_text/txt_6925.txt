The two-day national executive meeting of the Bharatiya Janata Party concluded on Sunday with Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressing a massive gathering in Hyderabad. As per news reports, there were over a lakh people present during Modi’s speech.

Now, a video of men wearing BJP caps and scarves distributing alcohol has gone viral. Those sharing it claimed it was from the aforementioned event. Advocate Prashant Bhushan tweeted the video and wrote, “Wow Modi Ji, your party has turned Telangana into Goa too! What fun!”

Former Lok Sabha MP Kirti Azad tweeted, “While PM Narendra Modi was giving a speech inside, BJP workers were enjoying wine and kebab in honour of India outside. This is the real face of their Hindu religion. It's not even worth ridiculing. The height of shame.”

The same video was shared by many on Facebook as well, who claimed this was from Telangana.

AFWA found that the viral video is old and not related to the recent BJP rally in Telangana.

The viral posts are archived here, here and here.

Under Bhushan’s tweet, several people pointed out that this video was old. Heavy woollen garments worn by the men seen in the viral video indicated this video was shot in winter.

When we reverse-searched frames from the video, we found that it has been on the internet since 2021 at least. This video was tweeted by several Congress leaders and even the official Twitter account of the Uttar Pradesh Congress on December 20, 2021.

The Congress leaders claimed that the viral video was shot somewhere in Haridwar, UP, just before the rally of BJP leader JP Nadda in December 2021.

Several news outlets carried this video around the time. However, none of the news reports, we found could identify the location and the date of the original incident.

We could, however, safely conclude that this video is not from the recent BJP meet in Telangana.
