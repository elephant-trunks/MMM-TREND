TN Seshan, former Chief Election Commissioner, is very much alive contrary to reports about his death doing the rounds on social media and news networks. The firebrand former CEC was known for his radical reforms in the election system in the country. Ironically, as news of his ‘death’ spread, some people even paid ‘homage’ to him on Twitter.

The fact of the matter is that TN Seshan lost his wife Jayalakshmi on Saturday. However, many of those who had tweeted about about the former CEC’s death apologized for their earlier reaction.
