Many newspapers in India picked up a PTI story which said that a new Pew survey indicated that 85% Indians trust their government, 55% support autocracy and 27% want a strong leader. Are these numbers put out by the Pew? What is the sample size of the survey? Here is a Fact Check.

What is this Pew Survey?

Pew Research Center is based out of the US and is known for public opinion polling on various issues. Pew has been conducting a global survey by name ‘Global Attitudes & Trends‘ that focusses on different themes each year. In 2017, the Pew survey referred to by the newspapers is a 38 nation survey about the support for democracy & its alternatives. This is a part of the Pew Research Center’s Spring 2017 Global Attitudes Survey. According to the Pew website, these surveys are conducted via telephone or face-to-face interviews, depending on the country. All the results are based on national samples.

What is the sample size for India?

According to the Pew website, India results are based on a sample size of 2464. All the interviews in India were face-to-face and were conducted in Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Gujarati, Marathi & Odia. The survey was conducted between February & March 2017.

What did the survey say about India?

Support to Democracy: In India, 8% were completely committed to democracy (do not support any other alternative form of government) while 67% were less committed to democracy (willing to support at least another non-democratic form of government). This is against a global median of 23% committed democrats & 47% less committed.

Satisfaction with Democracy: The survey found that the satisfaction levels with democracy were closely tied with what people felt about the economy. In India, 87% of those who felt economy was doing good were satisfied with democracy while only 53% of those who felt economic situation was bad were satisfied with democracy. Of all the people surveyed, 79% from India were satisfied with the way democracy was working, the highest such satisfaction level in the world along with countries like Sweden & Tanzania. Trust in the Government: The survey found that the trust in the national government was closely tied with the public satisfaction levels with democracy. In most Asian & Sub-Saharan African countries, the trust in the government was higher. In India, 39% trusted the government a lot to do what is right for the country while another 46% trusted the government somewhat to do what is right for the country. In all, 85% expressed trust in the government. Only 5 countries reported a more than 80% trust in the government including India. Four of these countries are Asian. Trust in Government linked to Economic Growth: The survey found that people in countries with high economic growth had greater trust in their governments. India, Tanzania, Philippines etc. represented this trend. Trust in the government was also closely linked to how people felt about the economy. In India, 92% of those who felt that the economic situation was good expressed trust in the government while only 55% trusted the government among those who felt the economic situation was bad. Citizens okay with both Direct & Indirect say in policy: Among those surveyed in India, the support for both direct & indirect say in policy matters found support. 75% felt that a system where elected representatives decide on law is total good while 76% also felt that a system where citizens directly vote on major national issues is total good. The survey also found 65% support in India where experts (technocrats) instead of elected representatives make policy. Support for Autocracy & Military rule: Despite overwhelming support for democracy & its functioning in India, the survey also found 55% support for autocracy in India. The survey also says that 27% back a strong leader. Further, 53% of those surveyed in India expressed support for a military rule in India, surprising considering that India is hailed as a great example of a democracy.
