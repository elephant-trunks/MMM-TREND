During a review of the Namami Gange project on Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi missed a step at Kanpur's Atal Ghat and fell on the stairs.

After the incident, Internet is abuzz with videos and photos of the same. And now, a photo showing a man in white kurta pyjama lying on the ground is doing the rounds on social media with the claim that 69-year-old PM Modi slipped on the stairs but Congress leader Rahul Gandhi fell on a flat surface.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the viral claim to be untrue. The man, seen lying on the ground in the viral picture, is not Rahul Gandhi but his brother-in-law Robert Vadra. A businessman by profession, Vadra is the husband of Rahul's sister Priyanka Gandhi.

Similar claims, along with the photo, have been made viral on Facebook and Twitter alike. The archived version of the post can be seen here.

With the help of reverse search, we found a YouTube video of news channel "NDTV", carrying the viral picture and reporting the incident. The video, uploaded on March 5, 2012, says, "Robert Vadra, who is Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law, fainted at a golf course in Gurgaon and was rushed to hospital. Mr Vadra was distributing prizes at a tournament at the DLF Golf Course when he suddenly fell down. His security guards helped him into a golf cart. He was then taken to the Medanta Medicity hospital nearby."

We also found similar information regarding the photo in a report by "The Times of India".

Therefore, it is clear that the viral post is misleading. The man seen lying on the ground in the viral picture is not Rahul Gandhi, but his brother-in-law Robert Vadra.
