A video allegedly showing a Garuda Indonesia airlines’ plane stumbling and crash-landing on a runway in Iran is doing the rounds on social media platforms. It is being claimed that the plane manages to land safely after “nearly crashing.” However, Newschecker has found the viral video to be fabricated and not related to any real incident.

Several Twitter users are sharing the viral video that claims to show an Indonesia airlines’ plane making an emergency crash landing at the runway.

#Indonesia #horror #indonesian plane is nearly crashing. Thanx #God for safe landing.#viralindonesia #viralindo #planecrash @indtravel @umashankarsingh https://t.co/wNe0ALxZFi — Ahimsa💫 (@Ahimsa1616) January 9, 2022 An extended version of the video is also being widely shared on Facebook which shows passengers coming out of the emergency exit of the Indonesia airlines’ plane after allegedly crash landing in Iran.

Fact Check/Verification:

To verify the authenticity of the claim, Newschecker did a keyword search for ‘Garuda Indonesia Airlines Plane Crash Landing’ on Google. We came across a report by a website called The Namal, dated January 10, 2022, which stated that the viral video “has been shared in a misleading context. It was actually created by a YouTube user with computer-generated imagery.”

We looked up the viral video with the help of Facebook Advanced Search and came across a page called ‘Lucky Loss’ which had posted 5-minute on November 12, 2020 showing the “Crazyest Landing ever seen by a Drunk Pilot.” The viral clip showing the Garuda Indonesia plane’s crash landing can be seen at around 1:15 minutes. The post also said that, “This is only in the flight simulation. This situation is not real!”

Newschecker further looked up for the “Crazy Emergency Landing By Drunk Pilot” on YouTube and came across a video uploaded by a verified YouTube channel called ‘Bopbibun’ on May 2, 2020, titled ‘Most Crazy Emergency Landing By Drunk Pilot | X-Plane 11.’

The viral clip claiming to show the emergency landing of the Indonesia Airlines’ plane can be seen at 5:50 minutes in the video uploaded by ‘Bopbibun.’ Notably, a disclaimer regarding the video stated, “This is only in the flight simulation. This situation is not real! Everything in this video doesn’t happen in real life, because this situation is just a challenge for me to try in the flight simulation.”

To further verify the extended part of the viral clip shared on Facebook, where passengers are seen coming out of the aircraft, we conducted a reverse Google image search and came across a report by a Turkish news website called ‘Akit’. The report carried the same footage of passengers coming out of the plane as seen in a viral video shared on Facebook.

The report stated, “The passenger plane of Iran-based Caspian Airlines skidded off the runway due to a technical malfunction in the landing gear.”

Conclusion:

Newschecker has found out that the viral video claiming to show the crash landing of a Garuda Indonesia airlines’ plane is fabricated. The first part of the video computer generated flight simulation while the second part shows passengers offboarding Iran-based Caspian Airlines’ plane after it skidded off the runway and not a Garuda Indonesia airlines’ plane.

Result: Fabricated/False Content
