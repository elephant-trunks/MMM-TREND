Spread the truth:

It’s all about timing, when there is much more to a photo that what can be seen.

Here a Self Proclaimed Congress Social Media coordinator Vinay Dokania posts a photo where while Abe and his wife are greeting (Namastey) statue of Mahatma Gandhi, our PM, Modi ji is not. In the tweet he claims that Modi Ji is a Nathuram Godse Bhakt (staunch follower) because of which Modi ji is not greeting Gandhi statue at Rajghat.

But, he did actually. Modi Ji did greet Mahatma Gandhi Statue, it’s just that either he raised his hands after Abe or brought down before it.

A chameleon cannot hide his true colours for long. Once a Godse Fan, Always a Godse Fan. Shame on your Mr PM. pic.twitter.com/54J34DePLO — Saral Patel (@SaralPatel007) September 13, 2017
