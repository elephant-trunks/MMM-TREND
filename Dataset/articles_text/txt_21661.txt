Egypt has been playing the role of a mediator in the recent Israel-Palestine clashes, seeking to enforce a ceasefire amid almost two weeks of fighting.

On social media, a picture of the Pyramids of Giza lit with colours of the Palestinian flag is circulating with the claim that Egypt is standing in support of Palestine.

A Twitter user shared the picture of illuminated pyramids and wrote, “The pyramids of Giza in Egypt are decorated with the flag of Palestine in support of our sisters in the occupied state of Palestine against the Zionist entity.”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the picture to be morphed. The original picture does not show the Palestinian flag lit on the Pyramids of Giza.

Several Facebook and Twitter users have shared the viral picture. The archived version can be seen here.

Using reverse image search, we found the original picture of the pyramids on a travelling website called “safinatours.com”. The caption in Spanish translates to, “Sound and light show in the area of the pyramids of Giza”.

In the original picture, one can clearly see that the Palestinian flag is not lit on the pyramids.

We also found the original picture on Wikimedia Commons, showing the sound and light show in the Pyramids of Giza, posted by user Ayah Ahmed in August 2014.

A comparison between the fake and original picture can be seen below.

Therefore, we may conclude that the viral picture showing the Palestinian flag lit on the Pyramids of Giza is edited.
