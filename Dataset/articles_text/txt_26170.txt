A poster is going viral on social media. In which it was claimed that the Vice President of the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, which makes the COVID-19 vaccine, has been arrested in a fraud case.

Sharing the poster, a user wrote, “Pfizer Executive Vice President Rady Johnson has been arrested from his home. Federal agents have charged him with several counts of fraud.”

Fact Check:

To check the above claim, when we searched about it on the internet, we found a sarcastic article. This article was published on the website ‘Vancouver Times’ on 6 May 2022.

The website clearly states that the Vancouver Times is the most trusted source for West Coast satire. We write satirical stories about issues affecting conservatives. We are not affiliated in any way with the mainstream media (CBC, CTV etc.), and any resemblance between our content and MSM’s work is purely coincidental.

Apart from this, we also got a fact check from the international news agency Reuters. A Pfizer spokesman told Reuters that the claims of Johnson’s arrest are “false”. “Ready Johnson has not been arrested,” a Pfizer spokesman said.

Conclusion

Therefore, the claim of arrest of Pfizer Vice President Ready Johnson is fake.
