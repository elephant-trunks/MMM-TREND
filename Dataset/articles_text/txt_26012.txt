Fact Check:

To check this viral claim, we did a simple search on Google. But there was no news of any action being taken under the Atrocity Act on the use of abusive words against Brahmins. Since the users who made the claim posted on May 25. That’s why we went to the website of the Supreme Court and searched for the decisions given by the court. We did not find any such information there also.

Thereafter, we contacted Supreme Court Advocate Siddharth Acharya. Siddharth Acharya told that no such decision has been given by the Supreme Court. He has termed such claims as misleading.

Conclusion:

Our fact check is proving that the viral claim is misleading. Because no such decision has been given by the Supreme Court.
