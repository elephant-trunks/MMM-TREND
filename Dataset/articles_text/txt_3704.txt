Dear Emmanuel Macron

People come and go, and you too shall leave this earth. Nations rise and fall, and a time will come when France itself shall not exist. But rest assured, the legacy of the Prophet ﷺ, and the love that all Muslims have for him, shall continue to live long after you and your nation are remains of the history books – Yasir Qadhi

I Protest against the disreputable and disrespectful demeanor shown towards our beloved Prophet Muhammad SAW. Do you?
