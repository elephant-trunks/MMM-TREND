BOOM found that the viral newspaper clipping is fake. Narendra Modi's younger brother Prahlad Modi had clarified to ABP in 2016 that he never gave such a quote to Amar Ujala. Even Amar Ujala's editor had then stated that the publication never ran an article with such a headline. BOOM had also reached out to Prahlad Modi in May 2019, when another fake newspaper clipping was being shared with these claims. Prahlad Modi had then told BOOM, rubbishing the claims saying, "No such thing had happened. I did not file any FIR against him (Narendra Modi), nor did my sister and brothers."
