Spread the truth:

US Economist Richard Thaler wins 2017 Nobel prize in economics and yes he did appreciate demonetization policy

This is a policy I have long supported. First step toward cashless and good start on reducing corruption. https://t.co/KFBLIJSrLr — Richard H Thaler (@R_Thaler) November 8, 2016

From above tweet, he appreciates the move by government which has been retweeted 1613 times

On him winning Nobel Prize, the screenshot of above tweet is spreading which certainly will reach you on whatsapp by tomorrow and you will be forwarding it, but wait, will you ?

The story of the tweet doesn’t end here, there is much to it. Same very day a twitter user told him about introduction of 2000 notes

@monikahalan @breakingmoney by introducing Rs 2000 note ???? — Naxals around us (@gkundra) November 8, 2016

And then reaction of Mr. Thaler was “really? Damn.”

really? Damn. — Richard H Thaler (@R_Thaler) November 8, 2016

So Why one would say “Damn” ?

That should be left to you all to comprehend.
