Spread the truth:

Photo of a girl dancing on stage in front of a crowd is tweeted by Samajwadi Party, Congress and Aam Aadmi Party supporters, where they questioned the need of celebration comparing with the unfortunate deaths of infants in BRD Hospital, many used sarcasm against Yogi Adityanath claiming this dance to be against culture, while the irony is, the photo is from Feb 2016, when Yogi Adityanath wasn’t a CM while Akhilesh Yadav from SP was :). Comparing celebration i.e Gorakhpur Mahotsav with Infant deaths indeed is a genuine question but this particular photo is old.

Aashish Yadav, Media Head of Samajwadi Party whose twitter bio says “Communication Specialist,Ex BBC Employee,सोशलिस्ट,History Lover,Traveller,From Jhansi.Tweets and RTs are personal.” tweeted this photo with text – “योगी जी का गोरखपुर महोत्सव, सतयुग की सभ्यता और संस्कारो को दर्शाता हुआ ! ”

The Irony boomeranged on himself as this guy is a Samajwadi Party Media Head and the above photo is from February 2016 when Akhilesh Yadav was CM, not Yogi Adityanath.

The left most guy is Ashish Yadav, Head of Samajwadi Party’s war room i.e Media/Social Media Head of the party.

And further in Self Insult list is a Manoj Rai Dhoopchandi, an ex- Samajwadi Party’s state spokesperson. This Ashish Yadav’s tweet was retweeted by him.

The Truth of irony is, while these all are claiming this so-called against culture dance to be under Yogi Adityanath, this took place under Akhilesh Yadav Government i. eFeb 2016
