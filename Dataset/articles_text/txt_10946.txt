Fact Check-

We started our investigation by running a Yandex reverse image search of a screengrab of the video whose results led us to an article published by Daily Mail on 4 September 2020. According to the report, this video went viral in 2020 claiming that Taiwanese military shot down a Chinese Su-35 fighter jet after it intruded into the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.

However, the Taiwanese officials have denied that it had shot down a Chinese Su-35 fighter jet after social media footage shows a crashed plane burning near a building. Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defence said the claim of it shooting down a Chinese Su-35 fighter jet was ‘false information’.

The Ministry of Defence in Taiwan has posted the same clarification on their Twitter account on 2020.

In response to rumors online that claim a Chinese Su-35 fighter jet had been shot down by Taiwan air defense systems, #ROCAirForce would like to categorically state this is fake news. We urge netizens to not spread it and strongly condemn this malicious act. — 國防部 Ministry of National Defense, R.O.C. 🇹🇼 (@MoNDefense) September 4, 2020

Following this, the Taiwan Fact Check Centre spoke to the Taiwanese Air Force in 2020, who clarified that the news is false. Their full response was-

“The news that Taiwan has shot down a Chinese warplane is completely false. We strongly condemn this kind of propaganda.” –Taiwan Air Force Command Headquarters.

Fact Crescendo Malayalam had published a fact check on this incident in 2020.

Conclusion-

Fact Crescendo found the claim made along with the viral video on social media to be False. The viral video does not show Ukrainian military shooting down a Russian Aircraft. The video is present on the internet since 2020. This video had earlier gone viral as Taiwan shooting down Chinese jet but the Taiwan Defence Ministry has refuted the viral claims.
