An image purportedly showing a large group of men rallying with India's national flag has been shared on social media with the claim that it is from Pakistan. According to the social media posts featuring this image, it shows members of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), a group advocating the rights of Pashtuns in Pakistan, rallying with the Indian tricolour to Islamabad.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the image shared along with the claim is morphed.

The original image shows local tribes of Bannu district in Pakistan and members of PTM rallying with a black flag to protest the killing of four Pashtun youths.

The archived versions of similar posts can be seen here and here.

AFWA probe

We did a reverse image search of the image in question and found the same carried by an ANI report published on March 28, 2021. However, in this image, the men can be seen holding a black flag instead of the tiranga. They can also be seen holding both black and white flags in the march.

The caption to the image reads, “Participants of Jani Khel dharna on Sunday marched towards Islamabad to protest the murder of four Pashtun youths.”

A comparison between the original image and morphed image can be seen below.

According to both, The Dawn and ANI, the image shows thousands of protesters from Jani Khel, a town in the Bannu district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan, marching to Islamabad with the bodies of four teenage boys. The bullet-ridden bodies were found in a field a week before the rally. The protesters were demanding action against anti-state elements.

Mohsin Dawa, PTM leader and member of the National Assembly, had also tweeted the same image with the caption, “Participants of Jani Khel Dharna marching towards Islamabad, we are on the way to join them in a while. #PashtunLongMarch2Islamabad aniKhelLongMarch2Islamabad” Participants of Jani khel dharna marching towards Islamabad, we are on the way to join them in a while. #PashtunLongMarch2Islamabad #JaniKhelLongMarch2Islamabad pic.twitter.com/r8qD3E37pN — Mohsin Dawar (@mjdawar) March 28, 2021 According to a PTM Twitter account in the Netherlands, the black and white flags seen in PTM rallies denote what the movement stands for; black representing their “oppressed state” and white for “non-violent peaceful struggle”. advertisement The plain all black and all white flags of #PTM are symbol of our recent history and what we #Pashtuns stand for. Black: our oppressed state, deprived of every right including the right to live. White: nonviolent peaceful struggle. #PashtunLongMarch2MiranShah @ManzoorPashteen pic.twitter.com/C30lPoq34z — PTM Holland (@HollandPtm) November 15, 2020 Hence, it is clear that the image in question is morphed and the original image shows local tribesmen from Jani Khel along with PTM members holding a black flag that they claim is a symbol of their oppressed state.
