A picture of RashtriyaSwayamsevakSangh (RSS) workers is going viral on social media. In which some youth are standing in RSS costume and a woman can be seen passing. It was claimed that this woman is the Queen of Britain.

Sharing this picture, a Facebook user wrote, “Britain Mata Ki Jai. This photo is hard to capture and should reach every phone. Let everyone know who is the traitor to the country. When the whole country was fighting with the British, some traitors were saluting the Queen of England. I have heard that their descendants call themselves patriots.(Translates Hindi)
