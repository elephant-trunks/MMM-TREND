A video of a scholar is getting viral on social media. In the video, a bearded man can be seen who can be heard provoking Hindus in the speech by asking them why they are letting the Muslim population suppress them.

Social media users claim the guy in the beard is from the Muslim religion who is provoking the Hindus. The video is getting a lot of shares on social media.

A user on Facebook writes, “He is a Muslim scholar. Everyone listen, think and forward this video to other Hindus also.”(Translates Hindi)

Fact Check:

We try to search for the reality of the video for this, we noticed that few people commented under the posts that the man is not a Muslim scholar, rather he’s Hindu and called Acharya Prashant Sharma. Then we searched the internet and found the video from which the viral clip was taken.

It was shared on Acharya Prashant Sharma’s official YouTube channel Darshnik Vichar.

The 12-minute-long YouTube video was titled, “What is the reason behind the murder of Udaipur’s Kanhaiya Lal, Why was Kanhaiya Lal murdered – Acharya Prashant.” The section seen in the viral video begins around the 1.50-minute mark.

We then also found a post on Acharya’s Facebook page where he posted that his video is being viral with a misleading claim of him being a Muslim Scholar.

Conclusion:

A video of a bearded man giving a provocative speech was not made by a Muslim scholar but by a Hindu preacher.

Claim Review: claim the guy in the beard is from the Muslim religion and is provoking the Hindus.

Claimed by: social media users.

Fact Check: misleading.
