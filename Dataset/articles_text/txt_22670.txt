An X-ray image of a chest with a cockroach has been shared on the Facebook page "Mr Scientific" along with the claim that this took place in a hospital in Zimbabwe.

The claim said that after the X-ray, the man was advised by doctors to go to India for surgery. As per the Facebook post, the man sold everything and came to India where he underwent another X-ray.

However, doctors in India told him that there was nothing in his chest; the cockroach was present in the X-ray machine in Zimbabwe, according to the bizarre claim.

The truth

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false. This is a fictitious story doing the rounds on social media for quite some years.

The viral image is photoshopped. The original picture is the X-ray image of famous yesteryear Hollywood actress Marilyn Monroe's chest.

In 2017, Facebook page "Let's enjoy Zimbabwe" posted this same image with a similar narrative. This was also shared by many users on Facebook in 2018.

Viral image is doctored

Using reverse image search, we found the original image, which is an X-ray of Marilyn Monroe's chest. In 1954, she was admitted to Cedars of Lebanon Hospital for surgery for endometriosis, a gynecological condition.

In 2010, a set of three X-ray images from this hospital visit were auctioned for $45,000. This was reported widely by mainstream media and can be read here.

Comparing the viral image with the original X-ray image, it is confirmed that the former is photoshopped. Signs of manipulation are clearly visible in the viral image.
