In a significant development following weeks of protests and a 'Save Our Rawalis' campaign, the Union Environment Ministry has ordered a complete ban on new mining leases across the Aravalli range. This Special Report by the India Today Open Source Intelligence team utilizes a 3D digital elevation model to analyze the topography of the region, highlighting the challenges of the new '100-metre rule'. The Unidentified speaker explains that unlike the Himalayas, the Aravalli hills lack uniformity, making the height-based classification difficult to implement. Satellite imagery from 2014 to 2025 reveals a significant increase in human footprints and mining 'scabs', particularly in Haryana, leading to deforestation and groundwater depletion. The report questions whether the new framework will effectively protect the vulnerable ecosystem or alter the structure of one of India's oldest mountain ranges.
