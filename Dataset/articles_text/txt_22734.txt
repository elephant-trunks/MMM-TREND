A photograph purportedly showing a rare Nagapushpa flower that perhaps blooms once every 36 years is being widely circulated on social media.

The claim

Nagpushpa blooms every 36 years. Yesterday at 3.30 am (early morning) it bloomed in Manas Sarovar, said the claim with the picture. Utpal Kumar Bose posted this claim on Facebook in 2016 but it has resurfaced again on social media. More than 16,000 people have shared it so far.

The fact

India Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this claim to be completely wrong. This is not any rare Himalayan plant, but a marine invertebrate (animal without a backbone) known as a "sea pen".

The probe

By using a reverse image search, we found that the original photograph was taken by Gordon B Bowbrick in 2013.

Sea pen is a marine invertebrate more like corals, which belongs to 'Anthozoa' class.

The name sea pen derives from its resemblance to quill pens. They occur in shallow and deep waters from polar seas to the tropics.

The word 'Nagapushpa' is a Sanskrit word for a tree whose scientific name is 'Mesua ferrea'.

This is an evergreen tree and it even blooms during dry seasons every year.

In 2016, international fact-checking website Snopes debunked the same claim.

The conclusion

The claim about Nagapushpa blooming every 36 years in the Himalayas is wrong. Also, the viral picture is of a sea invertebrate, not of any plant.
