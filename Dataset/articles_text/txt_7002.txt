A Hindu family of four in the US converted to Islam. Well, at least that is what a viral photo claims.

Many on Facebook shared a photo of four people — an adult man and an adult woman, and a boy and a girl. The photo also contained text that said that these four supposedly Hindu people in the US embraced Islam.

The India Today Anti Fake News War room (AWFA) found that the viral image is seven years old and from Egypt. It shows a German family that converted to Islam.

The viral posts are archived here and here.

A reverse search of the photo led us to an old news report that had published the viral photo along with other photos of the same family.

This article was published on the Egyptian news portal youm7.com on November 6, 2015.

According to this article, a German family had converted to Islam at the Al-Tawhid mosque in Hurghada City, Egypt on November 6, 2015. As seen in the viral photo, the German man, Donel Klaus, his wife, and their children were welcomed by the Imam of the mosque. Each family member was gifted a copy of the Quran.

The images were also posted on a Facebook page called “Muslim Players” on November 7, 2015, with the caption: “The German Donel Klaus and his family reverted to Islam today at Hurghada, Egypt. They entered Masjid At-Tawheed and asked for the Imam to declare shahada. Masha Allah!! Congratulations and welcome to your big family.”

Another youm7.com report on from November 7, 2015, gave details about how many foreigners converted to Islam on November 6, at the various mosques of the Egyptian city of Hurghada. It also mentioned the conversion of the Donel Klaus family.

We could not find any credible news report confirming any religious conversion of a Hindu family to Islam in the US recently. Thus, we concluded that an old photo of a German family that converted to Islam in Egypt was shared with a false spin.
