A strong earthquake of 6.4 magnitude jolted Assam and parts of Northeast India and North Bengal on April 28, extensively damaging buildings and cracking open roads and fields. Amid several photos and videos circulating on social media as the effects of the quake is one showing the interiors of a room shaking with terrifying noise.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading. The video is over two years old and not related to the recent earthquake in Assam.

Many on Twitter, including the social media handle of news channel “Mirror Now”, shared the video, linking it to Wednesday’s earthquake in Assam. Some on Facebook said the video is from Guwahati. The archived version of the post can be seen here.

Using keyword search, we found the viral video on YouTube, uploaded by a user Sarit Phumjan on December 1, 2018. In the description, Sarit claimed it was the footage of his house in Anchorage, Alaska, which was hit by an earthquake of magnitude 7.0 in 2018.

As per news reports, a major earthquake of magnitude 7.0 had struck Anchorage city in Alaska on November 30, 2018, injuring many and severely damaging buildings.

The timestamp on the YouTube video also suggests that it was shot on November 30, 2018. However, we could not independently verify the location of the video and the story behind it. But it is ascertained that the video is available on the Internet since December 2018, and hence, it has no relation to the recent earthquake in Assam.
