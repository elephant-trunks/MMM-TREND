Sanjiv Bhatt, a former police officer, misrepresented an old image as having been taken during the floods in Kerala, and used it to accuse Prime Minister Narendra Modi of "viscerally" hating the state.

The picture shows men repairing wires on electricity poles. "Kerala State Electricity Board workers trying to restore power even while facing heavy rains. This photograph was taken 5 days ago. Now you know why Modi and his Sanghi Thugs viscerally hate Kerala," Bhatt said in a tweet.

India Today's Viral Test team did a Google search for the image -- and it turns out that Mathrubhumi, a Malayalam newspaper, used it in an article published in October 2016.

That story was about Urjadyut, a Kerala electricity board project. In fact, the image has also been used in other articles related to the board.

As well, our Kerala correspondent told us the picture has been around for some time.
