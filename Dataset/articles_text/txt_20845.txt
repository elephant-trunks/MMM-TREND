On October 14,2021, users began posting a claim that the famous Akbar Road in New Delhi is being renamed to Samrat Vikramaditya Marg. The viral post was shared simply as a claim and also as a graphic by many on both Facebook and Twitter.

Fact-Check:

However, this claim is false. Representatives from Boom Live contacted P Singh, Superintendent Engineer (SE), Road-II Division of New Delhi Municipal Council and he dismissed the claim. There have previously been attempts by individuals to erect posters and banners on the roads but they have always been taken down by the authorities.

Hence, this claim is fake.
