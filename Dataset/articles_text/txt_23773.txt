During the one year of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's term, the Ministry of Railways has claimed several "new beginnings" and "key reforms". Among its achievements: More rail track (1,375 km) electrified in one year than ever before; earnings increased 12%; more bio-toilets were installed; and a feasibility report received from Japan for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train during 2014-15.

Fact Checker took a look at the claims and the reality.

1. 12% rise in earnings due to "key reforms": Earnings lower than previous two years.

Claim: An increase of 12.2% increase in earnings during 2014-15 due to “key reforms in Railways”.

Reality: The 12% increase in earnings during 2014-15 compared with 2013-14 is lower than 19% and 12.9%, respectively, during each of the previous two financial years, 2012-13 and 2013-14.

Year Actual Earning (In Rs crore) % Increase in Earnings Compared To Previous Year 2007-08 73,467 2008-09 81,659 11.2% 2009-10 89,230 9.3% 2010-11 96,681 8.4% 2011-12 104,154 7.7% 2012-13 123,901 19% 2013-14 (Provisional) 139,838 12.9% 2014-15 157,881 12.2%

2. Record electrification of rail track: It happens every year

Claim: 1,375 km of railway electrification completed during 2014-15, termed best-ever for Indian Railways.

Reality: Electrification data reveal such records are set every year. The increase in electrification between 2013-2014 and 2014-15 in terms of “route kilometres” is the least when compared to consecutive years over the past eight years (barring 2010-11).

3. Bio-toilets, a key achievement: Yes, since 2009

Claim: Bio-toilets have been stated as key achievements by Railways for 2014-15.

Reality: Bio-toilets, which treat human waste instead of letting it on to the tracks, were first installed in 2009: 11,777 bio-toilets have been installed in 4,356 passenger coaches till June 30, 2014.

4. Study Done For Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train: Series of such studies over 13 years

Claim: Feasibility report from Japan on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train.

Reality: Parliament data show a series of feasibility (or pre-feasibility) studies between 2002 and 2015.

Year Journey of Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train Feasibility Studies 2002 A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed by the Ministry of Railways and the Spanish Railways (RENFE) for undertaking a feasibility study for a High-Speed Train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad. The proposal has been sent to Ministry of Finance for further processing. Ministry of Finance has further forwarded the proposal to Spanish Embassy in New Delhi. A study was undertaken by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in 1987 for Railway Improvement Plan of Transport Capacity and Train Speed on the Delhi Kanpur section. Total investment was put at around Rs 2,200 crore (in 1987 prices) for laying a new high-speed corridor between Delhi and Kanpur. This study is about 15 years old. The traffic figures now indicate that Mumbai-Ahmedabad is the heaviest corridor. It is considered worthwhile to undertake a fresh study. The decision about its funding will be taken up once the feasibility of the project is established. It will be offered to prospective investors through the Build, Own, & Operate route or a Public-Private Partnership, based on the feasibility established. 2004 A Techno-economic Feasibility Study for running High-Speed Train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad has been initiated. The proposal will be considered on receipt of the report. 2005 Ministry of Railways had posed High-Speed Rail-Link Project between Mumbai–Ahmedabad under Development Study Programme of Japanese Technical Cooperation Programme for the year 2005-06, through the Ministry of Finance. Government has subsequently communicated to Japanese authorities that the feasibility study on the project may not be taken in view of the change of priority of the project. Feb 2006 The high-speed train project is no longer a priority of the Government of India. Ministry of Railways has got the Feasibility Study for the high-speed Rail-link project between Mumbai and Ahmedabad done through Rail India Technical and Engineering Services (RITES) Ltd. The estimated cost of the project was Rs 20, 352 crore. The rate of return was found to be very low. July 2006 There was no proposal before Government to commence bullet trains in the country 2007 During the budget speech for 2007-08, it was announced that Ministry of Railways will conduct pre-feasibility studies for the construction of high-speed passenger corridors for running high-speed trains at speeds of 300-350 km per hour; one each in the Northern, Western, Southern and Eastern regions of the country. Pre-feasibility studies shall be undertaken. It is expected that the pre-feasibility study shall take about two years. As per the budget speech, the proposal is to do pre-feasibility studies for running high-speed trains at a speed of 300– 350 kmph. 2010 Minister of Railways announced in the budget speech for 2010-11 that Railways will undertake construction of high-speed rail corridors in India. Railways have identified six corridors and as these projects require large investments, they will be taken up through the Public-Private Partnership route. Railways have proposed to set up a National High-Speed Rail Authority for planning, standard setting, implementing and monitoring these projects. 2011 A pre-feasibility study for a high-speed rail corridor between Pune-Mumbai-Ahmedabad has been conducted. The report is under examination by Railways and the State Governments of Gujarat and Maharashtra. Not possible to give any commitment for time schedule regarding introduction of High Speed trains on Indian Railway track. However, the proposal will be considered further, on receipt of reports. May 2012 The present status of the pre-feasibility studies for High Speed Rail project Pune–Mumbai/Ahmedabad: "The prefeasibility study has been completed." Dec 2012 The status of Pune-Mumbai-Ahmedabad (650 km) corridor, where prefeasibility studies has been completed, is: The final report submitted by the consultant has been accepted by the Ministry of Railways. The construction cost is estimated to be Rs 49,076 crore, and cost of rolling stock is Rs 6,783 crore (both at 2009 prices). The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) comes to 11.4%. Feb 2014 Pune-Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor pre-feasibility study has been completed and the final report submitted by the consultant has been accepted by the Ministry of Railways. For the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail corridor, a joint feasibility study is being done by JICA which is co-financed by the Ministry of Railways and Government of Japan. The study started in December 2013 and will take 18 months for completion. July 2014 As a part of the Diamond Quadrilateral High-Speed Rail Project on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad sector, two pre-feasibility studies have been completed, and, two studies, one a joint feasibility study and another, a business development study is in progress, as under: (i) A joint feasibility study for Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Corridor, co-financed by India and Japan, which started in December 2013, will be completed in 18 months. (ii) A Business Development Study is being undertaken by French Railways (SNCF) which will be completed in 2014. Feb 2015 For Mumbai-Ahmedabad sector, two studies, one a joint feasibility study, co-financed by India and Japan and another business-development study by French Railway (SNCF) have been undertaken. JICA submitted a first interim report in July 2014 and a second interim report in November 2014. SNCF has submitted the report in September 2014. A provision of Rs 100 crore has been made in this budget for a high-speed project from RVNL/HSRC (High Speed Rail Corridor).

5. Helpline is launched: It was ready for launch before UPA quit

Claim: Launching of a security helpline for passengers.

Reality: The plan was first approved for 2010-11 and just before the previous government finished its term, the ground work, including finalising the nodal railway zone (Northern Railway), executing agency, budget (Rs 5.2 crore) and signing an agreement with the telecom ministry, had been done.

6. 108 Adarsh (ideal) stations: Routine since 2009

Claim: Passenger facilities improved at 108 stations under the Adarsh-stations scheme.

Reality: This is a routine affair, since the Adarsh-stations scheme kicked off in 2009 (to provide drinking water, toilets, catering services, waiting rooms and dormitories, especially for female passengers, better signage).

Financial Year No. of Stations identified as Adarsh Stations No. of Stations developed as Adarsh Stations 2009-10 378 373 2010-11 201 132 2011-12 401 148 2012-13 278 131 2013-14 70 76 2014-15 0 108

7. Meghalaya gets a rail line: Work has been on for 19 years

Claim: Lumding-Silchar broad gauge section inaugurated, Meghalaya comes on the rail map.

Reality: Gauge conversion work of Lumding-Silchar section started in 1996-97. There was often no money to continue the line or law-and-order problems delayed work. The target date was extended several times over the past few years.

Year Status of Lumding-Silchar Broad Gauge Conversion 2000 Conversion of Lumding-Silchar section of N.F. Railway from metre-gauge into broad-gauge, Final location survey for diversions in the Gnat section to suit the requirement of BG and preparation of land acquisition plan and papers has been taken up. The paper alignment for entire length and staking of the alignment has been completed in 150 km. Earthwork and bridges are now in progress between Lumding and silchar in 90 km length (40 km from Lumding end and 50 km from Silchar end). 40% of the earthwork and 50 minor bridges in this 90 km length have been completed. Work of Silchar-Jiribam gauge conversion is being carried out as a material modification of this work. Expenditure incurred upto March 2000 is Rs 79.8 crore and an outlay of Rs 40 crore has been provided in Budget 2000-01. 2003 Earthwork and bridge works are in progress. An expenditure of about Rs 115 crore has been incurred on this project up to Mar 31, 2002. An outlay of Rs 70 crore has been provided for 2002-03. 2004 The gauge conversion of Lumding-Silchar-Jiribam is in progress. On Lumding-Silchar section, land acquisition for 342 hectare out of total 368 hectare has already been completed. Earthwork to the tune of 196 lakh cubic metres out of total 292 lakh cure and 181 bridges out of total 379 bridges have already been completed. Work on one tunnel is in progress and tenders for 18 tunnels are under finalisation. The anticipated cost of the project is Rs 1496 crore. An amount of Rs 265 crore has been spent on this project up to Mar 31, 2004 and an outlay of Rs 70 crore has been proposed in Budget 2004-05. No target of completion has yet been fixed. The completion of the project would depend upon availability of resources. In the past, efforts were made to get additional funds from Non-Lapsable Central Pool of Resources. However, it had not been feasible to allocate additional funds for Railway projects from this pool due to other, pressing demands of various states. Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) have advised that funds through Non-Lapsable Central Pool are provided only to those projects which are submitted by the North Eastern States in their priority list. Normally these projects do not include central sectors such as Railways. 2006 Lumding-Silchar conversion work adversely affected in hill section after the militant attack on Railway staff. In the militant attack on October 6, 2006, 12 persons including 11 Railway personnel were killed and two vehicles were damaged. 2008 The target for completion of Lumding-Silchar has been fixed as March 2011. 2009 Lumding-Silchar-Jiribam gauge conversion project: Overall physical progress is about 45%. The progress is adversely affected due to law & order problems in the region. Cost of the project has increased due to various reasons including price escalation, change in scope of work, standard of construction etc. The anticipated cost as per budget, 2009-10 is Rs 2,500 crore. The project is targeted for completion by March 2012. 2013 Lumding-Silchar gauge-conversion project is in an advanced stage of execution. Overall progress of the project is 85%. Project is targeted for completion by March 2015, subject to availability of funds

8. World Bank Loan for Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor: Approved by the previous government

Claim: Agreement signed for $1.1-billion loan from the World Bank for the Eastern Dedicated Freight (EDF) corridor.

Reality: The $1.1-billion loan from the World Bank for EDF corridor-II was approved on April 22, 2014, before Modi's term began. ■

Fact check 8

Fact Checker has received a response from the Ministry of Railways on this story. The para-wise remarks of the ministry are presented below:

1. 12% RISE IN EARNINGS DUE TO “KEY REFORMS”: EARNINGS LOWER THAN PREVIOUS TWO YEARS

Claim: An increase of 12.2% increase in earnings during 2014-15 due to “key reforms in Railways”.

Reality: The 12% increase in earnings during 2014-15 compared with 2013-14 is lower than 19% and 12.9%, respectively, during each of the previous two financial years, 2012-13 and 2013-14.

Railway’s remarks: Increase of 12.2 % in earnings during financial year 2014-15 is a correct fact but there was no mention of key reforms in Railways in this statement made by Railways. Though not stated, the growth in 2014-15 has been more policy driven as there were some key reforms initiated in Railways like better freight policies, system improvement etc.. In 2013-14, the growth was on account of multiple fare-hikes and tariff rationalization. In the financial year 2014-15, growth in freight loading by over 4% and 5.2% growth in NTKM contributed significantly to overall freight earning.

Further, in 2014-15, the yield has improved over previous years:

Item 2013-14 2014-15 %age improvement in Passenger Yield (i.e. earnings per passenger kilometer ) over the previous year 11% 22% % improvement in Freight yield ( i.e. earnings per million tonnes ) over the previous year. 6% 8%

2. WORLD BANK LOAN FOR EASTERN DEDICATED FREIGHT CORRIDOR: APPROVED BY THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT



Claim:Agreement signed for $1.1-billion loan from the World Bank for the Eastern Dedicated Freight (EDF) corridor.



Reality: The $1.1-billion loan from the World Bank for EDF corridor-II was approved on April 22, 2014, before Modi’s term began.

Railway remarks: - The agreement was signed on 11-12-2014; this is factual. The final approvals for signing the loan and the Guarantee Agreement were received on 30-10-2014 from the Department of Economic Affairs. The first contract for EDFC-2 was awarded in March 2015. We never claimed that this loan was initiated in this period. The formal signing formal agreement has its own significance as it then paves the way for actual execution.

3. RECORD ELECTRIFICATION OF RAIL TRACK: IT HAPPENS EVERY YEAR



Claim:1,375 km of railway electrification completed during 2014-15, termed best-ever for Indian Railways.



Reality: Electrification data reveal such records are set almost every year. The increase in electrification between 2013-2014 and 2014-15 in terms of “route kilometres” is the least when compared to consecutive years over the past eight years (barring 2010-11).

Railway remarks: Here again we stated the best ever performance of the Indian Railways in Railway Electrification. Bettering records is never a crime. We do not find any reason for objecting to it or being critical of it. Moreover, the target achievement of 1375 route Kilometres (RKM) was more than the target of 1350 RKM fixed for the year 2014-15. By the way the target has been enhanced to 1600 route kilometres for the year 2015-16, which is 18.52% higher than the target of 2014-15.

4. BIO-TOILETS, A KEY ACHIEVEMENT: YES, SINCE 2009



Claim:Bio-toilets have been stated as key achievements by Railways for 2014-15.



Reality: Bio-toilets, which treat human waste instead of letting it on to the tracks, were first installed in 2009: 11,777 bio-toilets have been installed in 4,356 passenger coaches till June 30, 2014.

Railway Remarks : - We never stated it as the “key” achievement by the Railways for 2014-15. We just mentioned the number of bio toilets fitted in the year 2014-15 which is sizable in this particular year. The complete picture on this is as follows: Fitment of IR-DRDO bio-toilets started in 2010-11 after signing of MoU with DRDO in March 2010. The pace of fitment of bio-toilets has increased in last one year. The number of bio-toilets fitted in last year (from July’14 to June’2015) is equal to what has been fitted in last about 4 years (i.e. from 2010-11 to June’14) taken together.

5. HELPLINE IS LAUNCHED: IT WAS READY FOR LAUNCH BEFORE UPA QUIT



Claim:Launching of a security helpline for passengers.



Reality: The plan was first approved for 2010-11 and just before the previous government finished its term, the ground work, including finalising the nodal railway zone (Northern Railway), executing agency, budget (Rs 5.2 crore) and signing an agreement with the telecom ministry, had been done.

Railway Remarks: -It is a fact that the security helpline was launched on All-India basis during the said period. This help line had been under planning stage for a long time, but it is also a fact that it was not materialising because of certain technical hiccups. It was expeditiously processed and all technical issues were resolved and the launch was accomplished.

Nowhere was it stated that the proposal for the helpline was started in this period.



6. STUDY DONE FOR MUMBAI-AHMEDABAD BULLET TRAIN: SERIES OF SUCH STUDIES OVER 13 YEARS



Claim:Feasibility report from Japan on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train.



Reality: Parliament data show a series of feasibility (or pre-feasibility) studies between 2002 and 2015. (See adjoining box)

Railway remarks : - We merely stated the factual position on this matter as follows : -

“Interim Report of feasibility study by Japan for Bullet Train on Mumbai-Ahemdabad corridor received. The final report expected in June/July, 2015. China to undertake feasibility study of introducing Bullet Train on New Delhi-Chennai corridor”.

The final report has since been submitted. It was never stated that the study was approved and started in this period. The article also mentioned detailed history of many previous study reports. In this connection it may be stated that as compared to the earlier pre- feasibility studies, the current study completed in July 2015 is a feasibility study having all the details of a detailed project report. This study has the detailed alignment, the location & plans of the terminal stations and depots and the stations enroute, the details technical parameters, comparison of different HSR technologies and completion cost. The previous studies were not in the nature of DPRs. The proposal for study by China for the New Delhi – Chennai Corridor was initiated in this period.

7. 108 ADARSH (IDEAL) STATIONS: ROUTINE SINCE 2009



Claim:Passenger facilities improved at 108 stations under the Adarsh-stations scheme.



Reality: This is a routine affair, since the Adarsh-stations scheme kicked off in 2009 (to provide drinking water, toilets, catering services, waiting rooms and dormitories, especially for female passengers, better signage).



Railway Remarks : - Again, here factual position has been stated which existed in this period. However the completed Adarsh-stations in 2014-15 is 10 more than those completed in the last year 2013-14.

8. MEGHALAYA GETS A RAIL LINE: WORK HAS BEEN ON FOR 19 YEARS



Claim:Lumding-Silchar broad gauge section inaugurated, Meghalaya comes on the rail map.

Reality: Gauge conversion work of Lumding-Silchar section started in 1996-97. There was often no money to continue the line or law-and-order problems delayed work. The target date was extended several times over the past few years. (See adjoining box)

Railway Remarks: - Here again factual position was stated as Lumding-Silchar broad gauge section was inaugurated and Meghalaya came on the rail map in this period. Nowhere was it claimed that the work for these was started or initiated in this period. And to make these inaugurations to happen, Railwaymen worked tirelessly even during harsh weather conditions, difficult geological conditions and adverse security situation. Major Steps Taken in 2014-15:

Fund Scenario: As the mega block was planned w.e.f. 01.10.2014, a lot of activities were required to be undertaken simultaneously to finish the job within 6 months. Initially an outlay of Rs 620 crores was provided in the budget 2014-15 presented in July, 2014. This was further enhanced to Rs 889 crore during the course of the year, (against the outlay of Rs 375 crore provided in 2013-14) which made completion of this project possible within the target.

Security Issues: As the mega block was taken, the law & order situation in the area worsened. With the help of Ministry of Defence, the situation was brought under control by Territorial Army already deployed in the area by extending its jurisdiction and providing additional resources. Since starting of this project, a number of incidents of kidnapping, murders of railway officials etc. have taken place.

Weather Conditions: This project falls in a high rainfall zone where annual rain fall is of the order of 3000 mm. A lot of preparations were required to be done before the mega block to finish the job within the allotted time of mega block. All these preparatory works were to be accomplished braving heavy rainfall during monsoons. It needed day and night working before and during the mega block.

Geological Challenges: The project passes through one of the most challenging Himalayan Geology needing an extra ordinary engineering acumen to understand the problems and to find out on the spot solutions. During the mega block, there were 101 locations where work had to be executed simultaneously. In addition, there were geologically difficult stretches where a lot of innovative solutions had to be adopted to make the track through. Railway engineers worked round the clock tirelessly to make this dream project through within the mega block of six months, with sheer grit and determination in the face of insurgency, difficult terrain, geological challenges etc. within the tight target set for this project.

The railways' clarifications only emphasise the points we make. We would only like to dispute their contention that some of the claims were not "key achievements". As the graphics in the government's own tweets show (below), they were indeed put forward as "Key reforms in Railways".
