The statue of polymath Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was vandalised at a college in Kolkata recently. After this, a question which is presently stirring the Bengal politics is - who destroyed the statue?

Meanwhile, some pictures went viral on social media claiming that CCTV footage revealed Muslim TMC workers vandalised the statue of Vidyasagar.

In the photos, some men can be seen destroying a white statue.

India Today's Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the viral photos have nothing to do with the statue of Vidyasagar.

The photos are from Iraq and the people seen in the pictures are Islamic State (IS) militants.

Apart from Facebook, this misleading post is also being shared widely on Twitter.

A simple reverse search cleared the air around the viral photos. We found a CNN news report published in March, 2015, which used these viral photos.

As per the report, IS had destroyed some ancient statues and artifacts in Northern Iraq.

The photos and videos of the vandalism made headlines back then as well.

Moreover, if one was to compare the broken statue of Vidyasagar with the viral photos, one can easily figure out the difference between the places of both the incidents.

Only investigations can reveal who vandalised the statue of Vidyasagar, but for now we can say that these viral photos are neither of Vidyasagar's statue being vandalised nor are they from India.
