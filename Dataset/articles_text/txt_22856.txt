If the Congress comes to power at the Centre after the Lok Sabha elections, will it waive off bills for those who die in hospitals? It is being claimed on social media that this facility will be available at both government and private hospitals.

Facebook page 'Congress for Madhya Pradesh' uploaded a post which claimed, "If the Congress comes to power at the Centre, then the entire bill will be waived off if a patient dies in any government or private hospital. That is why my vote is for Congress."

India Today Anti Fake News Room (AFWA) has found that no such promise was made by Congress.

The archived version of the post can be seen here.

The post has been shared by 18,000 Facebook users till the time of filing of this story. Many people have commented and even hailed the Congress for its plan.

On May 5, Facebook user Saif Ali Khan posted this same message on 'CM Kamalnath Fans' page. This post has been shared by more than 200 Facebook users.

AFWA looked at the poll promises made by the Congress which is compiled in its manifesto. On the 24th page of the manifesto, the Congress has spoken about health issues and how it intends to provide healthcare to each and every citizen. But nowhere in the manifesto, does it say the entire bill of a patient will be waived off in government or private hospitals if the person passes away.

Neither has any senior Congress leader spoken about it nor is there any document found on the Internet to support this claim. Hence, it is clear that Congress never made this claim.
