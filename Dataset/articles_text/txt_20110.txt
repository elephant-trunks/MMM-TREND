but, now a new account is created by the same name which is following the same pattern.

We too noticed many Pakistani accounts have tweeted on this.

So to investigate the viral picture, we reverse searched the image on Google and found the same picture of Putin but on screen in front of him was, many people and it was seemingly an image from a video conference.

Then we also found a report on euronews.com the same image can be seen there, in which the caption under the picture states, “Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting with Italian businessmen via videoconference at the Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow, Russia, Wednesday, Jan. 26, 2022.”

Conclusion:

Therefore, the image of Putin watching Imran khan news was in reality morphed as the actual image was of the video conference.

Claim Review: Russian President Putin Watching News of Imran Khan’s Victory.

Claimed by: Most Pakistani accounts.
