A video of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi playing shuttle badminton has gone viral on social media along with the claim that he was seen playing amidst the party's heavy defeat in Assembly elections.

"After Congress faced humiliation in the five states, Rahul Gandhi was seen playing badminton", quoted a Hindi Facebook page named "Best Hindi News" while sharing this video.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this claim to be not true.
