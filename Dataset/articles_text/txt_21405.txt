Prime Minister Narendra Modi is presently in Italy to attend the G20 summit. On Saturday, October 30, he also visited Pope Francis at his Vatican City residence.

Soon after, a picture of Modi is circulating on social media with the claim that, in a major humiliation, the PM was forced to take a taxi during his stay in Italy. The picture shows PM Modi along with a black vehicle that apparently has the 'taxi' logo on it.

The claim in Hindi translates to, "(The PM) has to ride a taxi in Italy. If we, being in the Opposition, are not able to tolerate it, imagine the condition of Bhakts who are forced to see the humiliation of their God on foreign soil."

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the picture is doctored.

The archived versions of the posts are saved here and here.

The viral picture has the watermark of news agency ANI, which was our biggest clue. We visited the official Twitter handle of ANI and found the original image posted at 1.23 pm on October 30.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi departs from the Vatican after his meeting with Pope Francis," reads the tweet along with a set of three images, including the viral one.

However, here we found the taxi logo on PM Modi's vehicle missing. Comparing this picture with the viral one, it becomes clear that the viral picture is an edit hit job.

We also found a video with the same caption uploaded by ANI on their YouTube channel. The exact frame can be seen in this video at 0.39 seconds.

Therefore, it is confirmed that the viral image of PM Modi apparently riding a taxi in Italy is morphed.
