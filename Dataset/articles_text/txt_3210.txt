A video of a group of women taking out a rally on the streets is being widely shared on social media with a claim that these are visuals of recent ‘Kalash Yatra’ held in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh.

‘Kalash Yatra’ is celebrated by women across India where they carry a ‘purna kalash’ on their heads and march towards temples to seek blessings of the almighty.

The video is being shared on Facebook with a Hindi caption, “कल अयोध्या में निकले कलश यात्रा का एक अद्भुत व मनोरम दृश्य”

(English translation: A wonderful and captivating view of Kalash Yatra in Ayodhya yesterday)

Here’s the link to the above post.

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim and found it to be MISLEADING.

Using the InVid Tool, we extracted keyframes from the viral video and performed a Reverse Image Search. This search directed us to a YouTube video that carried the same viral video on January 25, 2017.

The video description reads, “श्रीमद् भागवत कथा की भव्य कलश यात्रा मथुरा में आयोजित” (English translation: Grand Kalash Yatra of Shrimad Bhagwat Katha organized in Mathura)

Taking a cue from this, we did a keyword search and found longer version of the same video on a verified YouTube channel on January 30, 2017. The video description can be translated into English: “Gorgeous Kalash Yatra!! Mathura !! Shri Bhagwat Katha !! Devi Hemlata Shastri”

Thus, it is evident from the above information that a 2017 video of ‘Kalash Yatra’ from Mathura is being falsely shared as a recent one held in Ayodhya. Therefore, the viral claim is misleading.
