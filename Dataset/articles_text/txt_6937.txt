The name Goldy Brar has been in the news since Punjabi singer and Congress politician Sidhu Moose Wala was shot dead last month. Brar, a Canada-based gangster, had allegedly claimed the responsibility for the murder. Moose Wala’s assassination was met with grief from fans across the world.

Now, a video allegedly involving the gangster has gone viral on the internet. In it, a mob can be seen beating a man. The word “Goldy” could be heard several times throughout the video. Many shared the clip claiming it showed how a mob in Canada beat up the absconding gangster.

AFWA found that the man seen assaulted in this video is a Pakistani TikTok influencer called Hassan Goldy — who has nothing to do with Goldy Brar.

It’s all in the name

We started our search on Facebook, where we found a post from a Punjabi news platform called “Rozana Spokesman”. This post claimed that the viral video is not related to the alleged assassin of Moose Wala. Rather it shows Pakistani TikTok star, Hassan Goldy. The post stated that the TikToker had also uploaded a video, explaining the incident.

In his clarification video, Hassan Goldy said that he was beaten up by people close to him because of a personal dispute. He spoke at length about the incident but did not disclose any specifics.

India Today has reached out to Hassan Goldy to know more about the viral video. This story will be updated as and when he responds.

First time huh? Nope

This is not the first time a “Goldy” has fallen victim to something like this. In the aftermath of Moose Wala’s assassination, another man called Goldy Brar had gone viral because of a photo with Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann. AFWA’s report on the incident can be read here.
