A video being spread on social media, of fire at a CNG pump in Rohini, is factually incorrect. Incident of fire took place on 24th Mar at a pandal wherein no casualties were reported.#DelhiPolice acted promptly to help contain the situation. @dcprohinidelhi #DelhiPoliceUpdates pic.twitter.com/0MKJaNXFPE
