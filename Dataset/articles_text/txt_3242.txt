A video, where the NCP supremo Sharad Pawar purportedly uses ‘unparliamentary’ language while describing Hindu Gods and Goddesses, is going viral on social media, with many accusing him of being an atheist and a Hindu hater. Newschecker has found that the video is being shared out of context.

BJP leader Sunil Deodhar was among those who shared the video claiming to show Sharad Pawar slandering Hindu Gods and Goddesses. His tweets garnered over 1,500 retweets and over 2,500 likes.

Several other twitter users also shared the same video on their twitter page with similar allegations.

Fact check/ Verification

To check the authenticity of the claim, Newschecker analysed the video thoroughly and noticed the logo of ABP Majha, the Marathi news channel, on the right hand top corner. Taking this as a clue, we looked at the YouTube channel of ABP Majha and found the full video of his speech uploaded on the page.

Pawar was speaking at the 39th Annual Meeting of the Indian Society for Tribal Research and Development in Satara. On listening to the whole speech, we understood that Sharad Pawar was speaking with reference to two poems from poet Jawahar Rathore’s collection of poems ‘Dongrache Dhol’, in which the poet writes of the suffering and pain endured by stone sculptors from their perspective. The specific poem quoted by Pawar is titled ‘Patharvat’ or stone sculptor. The image of the same has been added below.

Referring to the meaning of the poem in broad strokes, Sharad Pawar said, “We cast your stone, we break it with our sieve and hammer. From that, it takes the shape of everything to prepare food and flour in your house. That’s what we do. It fills your stomach with flour from that caste.”

Explaining the poem further, he said, “In this poem, the poet says, today we have done many things. With our sieves, hammers and sweat. One day you worship. We made those idols of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh. You kept them in that temple, and for many years, we were not allowed to enter that temple. I want to ask you a question, we created Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh with our hammer and sieve. We are your God and the father of your God who made you. So we will not tolerate injustice. I remember that kind of poem, it was written by Jawahar.”

With this, we understand that Sharad Pawar was explaining the poem by paraphrasing the sentences and not quoting verbatim from the poem , triggering the confusion.

Further, on checking the YouTube page of ABP Majha, we realise that the channel shared the full speech of Sharad Pawar at 12:15PM, which is 17 minutes and 41 seconds long. The page further shared a shorter version from the speech at 1:47PM, which is 1 minute 43 seconds long, and carries the controversial aspect of the speech.

Soon after, the BJP Maharashtra shared the same video from their official Twitter page at 2:30PM. The video was shortened further and posted on social media platforms, accusing Pawar of being anti-Hindu.

After the controversy, on May 13, Sharad Pawar recited the same poem and also issued a clarification on the context of the poem.

Conclusion

A reference to the poem Pathravat written by Jawahar Thakur in Sharad Pawar’s speech has been shared out of context.

Result: False Context/Missing Context
