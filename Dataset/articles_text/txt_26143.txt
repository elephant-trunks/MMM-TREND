A screenshot is going viral on social media. It has been claimed in this tweet that the newly elected PM of Australia, Anthony Albanese will give $ 2.4 billion in funding to the World Economic Forum over the next three years.

A user posted on Facebook the caption “why??” along with the screenshot of the tweet.

Similarly, a Facebook user named Robert Obrain also posted the same tweet’s screenshot,” He’s only just got in and it’s already downhill all the way.” Reads the caption.

Fact Check:

On searching the internet, we found Anthony Albanese Australian Labor Parody (an unverified @AIboMP Twitter handle) tweeted on 23 May 2022, “Australia will fund $2.4 billion over the next 3 years to support the World Economic Forum, which is currently hosting the 2022 meeting in Davos, Switzerland. This will also be an opportunity to foster a sense of camaraderie, collective purpose, and common destiny.”

It should be also noted that there is no Twitter account of the newly elected PM of Australia Anthony Albanese from the @AIboMP Twitter handle. His Twitter account is verified by the Twitter handle @AlboMP and under the name Anthony Albanese. No such tweet has been made from his verified account on 23 May.

It is to be noted that in the handle @AlboMP of the verified account, “A” is followed by “L” whereas “A” is followed by “I” (I) in the unverified account.

Conclusion:

A fake Twitter account has been tweeted in the name of Australia’s newly elected PM Anthony Albanese. Hence the claim made through the screenshot is false.

Claim: Australia’s PM announced $2.4 billion in funding to the World Economic Forum over the next three years Claimant: Social Media Users Fact Check: Fake
