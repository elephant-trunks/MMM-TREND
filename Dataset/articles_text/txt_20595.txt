Fact Check

Our research led to a different fact where Anita Anand, MP of Oakville has cleared the confusion by tweeting Canadian Force is not Canadian Police and the government has yet not planned to involve Arm forces in the protest happening in Ottawa.

The @CanadianForces are not a police force. As such, there are no plans for the Canadian Armed Forces to be involved in the current situation in Ottawa in a law enforcement capacity. https://t.co/7ZJF72diQw — Anita Anand (@AnitaAnandMP) February 3, 2022

After checking the sites, we didn’t find any such news on the Canadian website, newspaper or any newspaper in that case. Therefore the claim is fake and misleading as there’s only one news that Army won’t get involved in the protest as time soon.
