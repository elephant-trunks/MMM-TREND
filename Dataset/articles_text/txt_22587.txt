Have international soccer stars Cristiano Ronaldo, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Mohamed Salah expressed solidarity with the people of Gaza by bandaging an eye?

Facebook page "All About Islam posted a collage of four photographs -- three of the footballers with one eye covered and the fourth with a message that says, "Pray for your brothers and sisters in Gaza". The caption of the post reads, "U don’t need to be Muslim to care about Gazau... u need to be human".

advertisement India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the post to be misleading. The images of the footballers are photoshopped.
