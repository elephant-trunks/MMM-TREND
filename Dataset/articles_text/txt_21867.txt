The temple city of Varanasi is expected to get a new look after completion of the multi-crore beautification and expansion work under the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project. It is one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pet projects for his constituency.

However, a viral picture showing swanky roads and skyscrapers surrounded by blue waters is going viral on social media with the claim that it is the riverside of Varanasi.

Several Facebook users with a caption in Hindi which translates to, “A beautiful view of Banaras on the banks of Ganga. This is the result of Modi ji’s hard work.”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that though work on the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project is in full swing, this picture is of Dubai’s Palm Jumeirah, known for its glitzy global hotels and posh towers.

The archived versions of the viral posts saved here, here and here.

The viral image

The picture in question is an iconic photograph of Dubai. It is widely available on the Internet and on various photo galleries.

The picture is an aerial view of Dubai’s famous Palm Jumeirah, an artificial, palm tree-shaped island, featuring high-end hotels and apartment towers. This man-made archipelago has featured in several news media.

It is true that Varanasi is getting a makeover under the Kashi Vishwanath corridor project. But the viral image showing skyscrapers amid blue waters is from Dubai and not Varanasi.
