A short clip showing several vehicles with passengers inside crushed under a concrete slab is circulating on social media with different claims. While some say the video was taken after the under-construction Balanagar-Jeedimetla flyover in Hyderabad collapsed, others say it is a recent incident from Uttar Pradesh.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claims along with the video are misleading. This is a 2018 video of an under-construction flyover that collapsed in Uttar Pradesh’s Varanasi.

Using the InVID tool and appropriate keywords, we found that the video was carried by several news reports in 2018.

According to a report published by NDTV, the incident took place on May 16, 2018, when two pillars of an under-construction flyover collapsed in Varanasi’s Cantonment area.

Some 19 people were killed and many injured after several cars and a local bus got crushed under the concrete pillars. A video report on the incident by “The Quint” can be seen below.

A report by “The Times of India” on July 28, 2018, said eight persons, including engineers of the UP Bridge Corporation and a contractor, were arrested in connection with the incident.

Meanwhile, as the video went viral on February 24, the official Twitter handles of Telangana Police, Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority and Telangana urban development secretary Arvind Kumar tweeted to confirm that no such incident took place in Hyderabad.

Also, we could not find any recent report of an under-construction flyover collapsing in Uttar Pradesh. Hence it is clear that the video in question is nearly three years old and not recent.
