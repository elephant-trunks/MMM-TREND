Truth

This is a 3 year old video from Bangladesh, not Kolkata.

Before we get into details of how we found out the truth, you should know that the Kolkata Police have called Tarek Fatah’s tweet fake and initiated a legal action on him following which he deleted it with an apology and his tweet was retweeted by approximately 7K people and has made it’s way to various other Social media platforms too.

Yesterday I tweeted about a protest march that I was made to believe took place in Kolkata. It turns out I was given the wrong information. The protest march was held in Dhaka, not Kolkata. I have therefore deleted that Tweet and would like to apologize to you for my mistake. pic.twitter.com/yERQaS7rGB — Tarek Fatah (@TarekFatah) August 28, 2020
