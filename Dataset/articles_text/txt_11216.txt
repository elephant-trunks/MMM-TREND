Fact Crescendo found that the information is misleading as the festival where the project bagged the award is not the more popular Cannes Film Festival but is the Cannes World Film Festival. Here are the details:

Fact Check Methodology:

At first we got in touch with Joi Barua himself, who told us that some of the reports published by the regional media are factually incorrect. He informed us that he has noted down the important points about the recognition in a Facebook Post.

The caption of the post shared on March 21 at 10:32pm reads: “So PROUD!!!

The ‘Fantasy of Companionship between Human & Inanimate’ – the animation film which has our songs played by the London Symphony Orchestra and the London Voices, wins the award for the Best Soundtrack at the ‘CANNES WORLD FILM FESTIVAL’, FEB ‘21.

Also it makes a clean sweep of the various other awards.

Thank you all !!!!!

He also told Fact Crescendo that the award wasn’t given for a song “New Song Order” as published by a few media outlets in the region. He clarified that they won the award for the Best Soundtrack.

Following this, we looked up the website of the Cannes World Film Festival and saw that it is a Gold FilmFreeway Festival and an IMDb Qualifying monthly & annual competition of all genres for international filmmakers.

Following this, we saw that the Wikipedia page of The Cannes Festival mentions it was called the International Film Festival (Festival international du film) until 2003 and is known in English as the Cannes Film Festival. It is an annual film festival held in Cannes, France, which previews new films of all genres, including documentaries, from all around the world. Founded in 1946, the invitation-only festival is held annually (usually in May) at the Palais des Festivals et des Congrès.

The Cannes World Film Festival where Joi’s work won the recognition is not the same as the Cannes Film Festival.

Result:

Singer, Composer Joi Barua was a part of the team that won the Best Soundtrack award at the Cannes World Film Festival and not Cannes Film Festival. The two festivals are held at the same city, Cannes but are different festivals. The information that Joi Barua won an award at the Cannes Film Festival for a song titled “New World Order” is misleading.
