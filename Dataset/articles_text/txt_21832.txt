On this broadcast, India Today's Senior Anchor Anjali Istwal and Special Correspondent Amit Bhardwaj discuss the removal of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Goa President Amit Palekar. The decision by the party's Political Affairs Committee (PAC) comes after a 'flop show' in the recent Zilla Panchayat elections, where AAP won only one out of 40 seats despite aggressive campaigning by top leaders Arvind Kejriwal and Atishi. Bhardwaj reports that Palekar, a prominent face who led the party ideologically, has been made the 'fall guy' for the debacle. The programme notes that State Organization Secretary Shrikrishna Parab will take temporary charge as the party looks to rebuild ahead of the next Assembly elections.
