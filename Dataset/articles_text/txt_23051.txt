A photo which is doing the rounds on social media claims that alleged fugitive and businessman Nitin Sandesara is a friend of BJP biggies - Home Minister Rajnath Singh and BJP president Amit Shah.

Gujarat-based businessman Sandesara is the owner of pharma giant Sterling Biotech. He is the prime accused in the Rs 5,000-crore bank fraud case and fled the country.

The Congress supporter Facebook page, 'With INC', uploaded a photo in which a man is seen posing with Singh and Shah. A message put up with the picture states: "5700 crore rupye ka chuna lagakar Nigeria bhagne vala # Nitin _Sandesara kiska dost hai . isliye media khamosh hai."

This Facebook page, which has got nearly eight lakh followers, has triggered a controversy on social media with many claiming the person in the picture to be Sandesara. The photo has already been shared more than 18,000 times.

India Today Fact Check team found the claim totally false. In the photo, the man who is posing with Singh and Shah is West Bengal BJP secretary Ritesh Tiwari.

When we looked for Sandesara's pictures on the Internet, it was clear that there is no match between the pictures of Sandesara and the man in the viral photo.

When we reverse searched the viral photo, we found some newspaper article referring to the person as Tiwari. We contacted Tiwari on the issue. He confirmed that this is his picture with Singh and Shah. The photo was taken on April 18, 2016, in Kolkata during the West Bengal Assembly elections. He was the BJP candidate from Chowrangee seat.

This clearly put to rest the false claim made by netizens on social media.
