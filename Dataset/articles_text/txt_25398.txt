“The Income Tax Department’s search at Karnataka Energy minister DK Shivakumar’s Sadashivnagar residence in Bengaluru has yielded nothing.

The document shows that no money or jewellery was found during the search conducted at the residence on August 2. I-T officials continued the search for the second consecutive day ( August 3) as well. Current indications are that the search will continue for today as well.” – India Today
