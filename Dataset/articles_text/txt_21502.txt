Hundreds of Afghans rallied in Kabul and other cities on Tuesday, raising anti-Pakistan slogans and calling out Islamabad for its support to the Taliban.

According to reports, Pakistan provided air support to the Taliban in its battle against resistance forces in Panjshir. While the Taliban claimed to have captured Panjshir, resistance forces said their fight would continue.

In the backdrop of these developments, a video of a man being interrogated by some men in uniform is circulating on social media with the claim that a Pakistani fighter was caught in Panjshir. Netizens are sharing the video with hashtags such as #EndProxyWarInAfghanistan.

We noticed that in the comment section of the viral video, several people pointed out that it is an old clip.

Using keyword search, we found that the same video was shared on Facebook in December 2018.

We could not independently verify the exact location or timing of the video. However, it is clear that since the video is present on the Internet since at least December 2018, it is not related to the recent developments in Afghanistan.
