A picture of Raghav Chadha, a Rajya Sabha member of the Aam Aadmi Party from Punjab is going viral on social media. In the viral image, he can be seen standing in front of a Mahatma Gandhi statue outside the Parliament House.

He is holding banners in both of his hands. On one of the banners, Punjabi is written stating, ‘Allow Kejriwal to go Singapore.’

On another, it is written, 'Delhi and Haryana should get equal water rights.’

Social media users are sharing it with the claim that Raghav is asking for water rights for the people of Delhi and Haryana.

A user on Facebook shared the image and wrote, “Is the Raj Sabha member of Punjab asking for justice for the interests of Punjab? Just look at the photo.”
