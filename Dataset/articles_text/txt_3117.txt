FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim and found it to be MISLEADING.

Using the InVid Tool, we extracted keyframes from the viral video and performed a Reverse Image Search. This search directed us to a news report published on June 26, 2022, that carried the same viral video. According to the article, the children were saved by someone else, and not their father. The rescuer was identified as Ali bin Nasser al-Wardi, a photographer who was present at the time of the incident in Oman. Father of the children was also there when the incident took place.

Ali bin Nasser al-Wardi also made it clear in another news article that both the children are safe. The article also reported that Ali bin Nasser al-Wardi was hailed by the people and the government in Oman.

Thus, it is evident from the above information that the viral video does not show a father saving his two drowning children. Therefore, the claim is misleading.
