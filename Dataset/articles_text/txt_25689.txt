An image of a flooded garment showroom is being shared on social media with a claim that the picture is from Mumbai.

The post is being shared on Facebook with a caption that reads, “#mumbai #rains Raymond’s Borivali Showroom swimming suits.”

Here’s the link to the above post.

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim and found it to be Misleading.

A simple Reverse Image Search directed us to a news article published on September 28, 2019, that carried the same image. The headline of the article read, “Retreating monsoon caused havoc in Bihar, water entered the Raymond showroom in Patna, Bihar.”

Searching further, we found a tweet by News18 Bihar that also carried the same image stating “Heavy rains have disrupted normal life in Bihar. Home, hospital, office, shop, showroom, market water is accumulating everywhere. See pictures of waterlogging in Raymond Showroom located opposite Hathua Market in Patna.” The tweet was posted on September 28, 2019.

According to a India Today article dated September 30, 2019, flooding triggered by heavy rains in Bihar claimed lives of more than 29 people. Heavy rainfall in the state caused rivers, especially the Ganges, to swell up. All essential services, such as transportation and electricity, were also disrupted.

ABP News Hindi also did a ground report on how Patna’s clothing shops were impacted by heavy rain in 2019.

Thus, it is evident from the above information that an old image from Bihar is being shared as that of a flooded garment showroom in Mumbai. Therefore, the claim is misleading.
