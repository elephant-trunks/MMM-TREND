In rural areas, while Muslim households in rural areas spent only Rs 3 per month more than Hindu, they spent Rs 580 per month less than Hindu households in urban areas, said the September 2017 paper by Monojit Das, deputy director of field operations at the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), India's official socio-economic surveyor.

Christian households were the richest among the three major religions in both rural and urban areas, spending Rs 2,200 and Rs 3,242 per month respectively.

The research was based on NSSO's survey in the year ending June 2012. Das considered three religions--Hinduism, Islam and Christianity--because these contribute to about 97% of the total population. Others included Sikhism, Jainism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism and other smaller religions.
