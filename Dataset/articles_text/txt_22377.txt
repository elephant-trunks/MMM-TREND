A video clip of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi's car being stopped by a policeman at security check is getting viral on social media. The policeman can be heard saying that section 144 has been implemented in the area.

It is being claimed that the Gandhi siblings were breaking coronavirus lockdown rule by trying to moving out in the curfew to aid Muslims.

India Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is around four months old. It was shot on December 24, 2019, when Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi were prevented from entering Meerut. People in the video can be seen wearing heavy woolens and jackets indicating that it was shot during winters.

As per the media reports, Gandhis were on their way to meet the families of those killed in violence during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act. These media reports also includes viral video.

According to the police, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi were served with a notice that section 144 of the CrPC has been imposed and the situation in the Meerut was sensitive.

Hence, it is clear that the viral video is old and it has no connection with coronavirus. The first confirmed case of coronavirus was reported on January 30 in India.
