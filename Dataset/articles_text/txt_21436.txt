Social media has been in overdrive ever since the arrest of Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan in a drug bust. The incident has divided netizens, with some coming out in support of the megastar, while others calling for his boycott.

Amid this, a collage of two images is going viral with the claim that while 'bhakts' on Twitter have called for SRK's boycott, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey himself is with the superstar at Mannat.

While one image shows King Khan's residence in Mumbai, the other shows SRK and Dorsey in a meditative position. Superimposed on the collage is a tweet purportedly written by Dorsey and addressed to Khan. It says, "knock-knock".

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that both Dorsey's tweet and his picture with SRK are old and not related to the events surrounding Aryan Khan's arrest. Dorsey visited SRK at Mannat on November 14, 2018, and the picture was tweeted by the superstar after the meeting.
