Using InVID and reverse image search, we found that the viral video was published by multiple news outlets last month.

According to these reports, an IAF Mi-17 helicopter had crash-landed in eastern Arunachal Pradesh with two pilots and three crew members on board on November 18.

The helicopter was carrying out a maintenance sortie from Hayuliang to Rochham when the incident took place near Rochham helipad. ITBP troops rescued all the passengers safely.

News agency ANI had posted the same video on November 18, and said a local had videographed the incident.
