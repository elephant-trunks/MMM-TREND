Fact Check:

To know the truth behind Farmani Naaz’s announcement of converting to Hinduism, we started investigating Farmani Naaz’s social media accounts. We checked her official verified Facebook account. We found a video here. In this video, Naaz is clarifying that people have made a fake claim by creating a fake ID on her Twitter. She said that everyone has their own religious beliefs, they are part of the religion they belong to.

On the other hand, she has told about her official Twitter ID in this video. The official ID of singer is @farmaninaaz 786 . On this ID too, Farmani has posted a video with an explanation.
