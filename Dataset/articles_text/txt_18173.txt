The same photograph was viral in November, 2019, with claims that it showed the last prayers being offered at the site of the mosque in Ayodhya, following the Supreme Court verdict, which ordered the government to set up a trust to build a temple while allocating a separate land for the construction of a mosque. BOOM did a reverse image search and found that the photo is from Delhi's Feroz Shah Kotla mosque where people were offering prayers on the occasion of Eid al-Adha. The image was clicked on December, 2008 by international wires agency Associated Press (AP) photographer Gurinder Osan. The photo was captioned as "Muslims offer Eid al-Adha prayers at the Ferozshah Kotla Mosque in New Delhi, India, Tuesday, Dec. 9, 2008. Muslims worldwide are celebrating Eid al-Adha, or Feast of the Sacrifice. (AP Photo/Gurinder Osan)". The Feroz Shah Kotla was a fortress built by Feroz Shah Tughlaq, ruler of the Delhi sultanate.
