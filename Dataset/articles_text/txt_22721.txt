Since the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir was ratified by the parliament along with the repeal of Article 370, many claims of protests in the Valley are getting viral on social media. One such video being shared is of a huge crowd of women protestors taking to the streets and chanting Azadi.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is from last year.

Facebook user FB News TV uploaded the protest video with a caption in Hindi that translates to, Thousands of Kashmiris protested on the streets of occupied Kashmir to free their land.





This post has been shared more than 400 times till the time of filing this report. The archived version of the post can be seen here. Many other Facebook users shared the video with the same claim.

AFWA did a reverse search of the video and found that it was uploaded on Twitter and YouTube in March this year. Putting the YouTube video through InVID fake video debunker, AFWA found that the video was first uploaded on YouTube on December 12, 2018.

AFWA took a closer look at the video and found that towards the end of the 39-second video, a hoarding on a bank says Baramulla Central Co-operative Bank Ltd, Hajin. Looking through a map, AFWA found that this bank is located on the Baramulla-Srinagar highway near Baramulla police station.

Thus, it is clear that though the video is from Kashmir, it has no relation with the recent developments in the Valley.
