Following countrywide (sometimes violent) protests against controversial remarks on the Prophet Muhammad, social media has been abuzz with videos and photos supposedly capturing said violence. Different people have accused Hindus, Muslims, and even the police of instigating violence.

Among such media is the footage of a group, some donning saffron, pelting stones from the roof of a house.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the claim was misleading. The video was not shot during the protests over the comments made by now-suspended BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma. It showed the clashes that broke out in Madhya Pradesh's Khargone in April 2022 during Ram Navami celebrations.
