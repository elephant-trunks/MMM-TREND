A picture is getting viral all around the internet in which there are unemployment rates from the year Jan-Mar 2020 to July-Sept 2021. People are posting it to show their agitation against the failure of the Modi government in providing employment.

A page named Rahul Gandhi Fans on Facebook too posted the same picture.

Will Modi ji make India a world guru by raising an army of unemployed? (translates Hindi) the caption reads.

Fact Check:

In India NSSO (National Sample Survey Organization) surveys every 5 years. It collects data on the employment and unemployment rates from 1972-73.

The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) was designed with two major objectives for

measurement of employment and unemployment. The first was to measure the dynamics in the labour force participation and employment status in the short time interval of three months for only the urban areas in the Current Weekly Status (CWS). The second one was, for both rural and urban areas, to measure the labour force estimates on key parameters in both usual status (ps+ss) and CWS.

The data that is claimed is true to some extent but not totally correct as such. As this data included the quarter Jan-Mar 2020 (the quarter before the COVID-19 lockdown) is compared to the July-Sept 2021 quarter, which is after the initial lockdown.

Recently PSLF has released its recent data.

The unemployment rate declined from 6.1% in 2017-18 to 4.8% in 2019-20. The male unemployment rate declined from 6.2% to 5.1% and the female unemployment rate declined from 5.7% to 4.2% in the last few years.

The initial lockdown in 2020 and the second wave of COVID-19 have impacted the unemployment rates. The unemployment rates were high during these periods.
