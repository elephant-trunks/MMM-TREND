Celebrating Mahatma Gandhi’s 145th birth anniversary at the White House on October 2nd 2014. This is the Hindu American Seva Communities fourth annual conference.

******Disclaimer: this is not an official White House endorsed event. This is a conference/briefing where Hindu-Americans gather to discuss seva and social justice at the White House thanks to the outreach of the current administration. The day was engaged in a dialogue and discussion about the importance of service and its relevance in the larger Hindu and American communities. Last year’s conference was celebrating Swami Vivekananda, this year was about Mahatma Gandhi’s legacy.******
