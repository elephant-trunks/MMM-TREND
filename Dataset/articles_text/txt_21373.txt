A video of a woman arguing with the flight crew over her co-passenger’s vaccination status has gone viral. In the video, the woman is seen adamantly saying that since her co-passenger is not vaccinated, she should be given a different seat. To this, the flight crew politely responds that she can’t be given another seat since the flight is full.

The woman then threatens the crew, saying, “Do you wanna lose your job? Do you want me to call the cops?”

Later, when things get heated up, the pilot intervenes and tells the woman that there would be no discrimination on his aircraft on the basis of vaccination status. He instead asks the woman to exit the aircraft. Hearing this, all passengers begin to clap.

Some YouTubers have claimed that the incident took place in London.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video does not show a real incident. It’s a three-minute short film named “Covid Flight”.

Fact-check website “HoaxEye” pointed out on Twitter that the viral video is in fact a short film called “Covid Flight” and listed on IMDb.

The person who acted as the pilot was Sean Pogmore, whereas the role of the angry passenger was played by Diana Winter. The film’s executive producer Prince Ea also shared the same video on Facebook.

Clearly, a scripted video is being circulated as a real incident.
