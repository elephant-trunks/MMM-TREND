In BBC’s article, the writer embedded the famous tweet by Mohit Benewal, where he mentioned about Asia’s biggest Airport is in Noida. Although BBC didn’t mention the airport in the article but displayed it on the wall of the article. Mohit Benewal is the BJP president of West UP. He has pinned the tweet where he is honored to receive PM Narendra Modi as a guest at the airport.

“#पश्चिम उ०प्र० में नोएडा में एशिया का सबसे बड़ा #NoidaInternationalAirport की सौगात देने के लिए मा०

प्रधानमंत्री जी का हार्दिक आभार!#नएयूपीकी_उड़ान” says Mr. Benewal.

Fact Check:

BJP West UP President mentioned Noida airport as the largest one in Asia, in reality, there is no airport built in Noida. Asia’s largest airport is in Beijing called Beijing Capital International Airport. The only airport we have in Delhi NCR is Indira Gandhi Airport. You can also find fake and misleading pictures on Google of this forgery airport.

As per DFRAC’s last report that says, “Fact-Check: Hundreds of users including BJP leaders post pictures of Beijing Airport to show the new Jewar Airport”.

Conclusion: BBC highlighting the entire tweet can be a sight of misleading or just an error. As we are aware of the fact that Ad campaigns in elections are a hub of fake and misleading news, so keep your guard up.
