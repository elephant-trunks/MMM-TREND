Spread the truth:

There are many genuine photos on internet of Nehru & Edwina together, many stories afloat too, but this particular photo is false.

This is a Photo from a play “Love in the time of Partition”

So the people in photo are actors not Nehru and Edwina themselves.

“Love in the time of Partition

A new play in London about the last days of the Raj deals with the problem of withdrawing from a country — and with Edwina Mountbatten’s relationship with Jawarharlal Nehru. Amit Roy meets the playwright, Howard Brenton” – The Telegraph
