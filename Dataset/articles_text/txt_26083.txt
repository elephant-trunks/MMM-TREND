A video is going viral on social media. In this video, there is a huge crowd of people on the road under a metro station. Slogans are being raised by the crowd. Users sharing this video are claiming that this video is from Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan. They claim that Ram Bhakts have recited Hanuman Chalisa on the road while answering Namaz in Jaipur.

Sharing the video, a user named Arvind Kumar Singh wrote – ” While answering Namaz in Jaipur, Ram devotees read Hanuman Chalisa on the middle road .. My heart became happy seeing their numbers. My Hindu has woken up. Jai Shri Ram ”

At the same time, many other users have also shared this video with the same claim.

Fact Check:

To know the truth of the video going viral, we reverse searched some of the frames of the video. On searching, we found a video uploaded on the YouTube channel of Labbaik News on January 4, 2021. It is written in the description of this video that this video is from Chehallum of Allama Khadim Hussain Rizvi. Let us tell you that Labbaik News is a Pakistani channel.

Conclusion:

This fact check proves that the video going viral is not from Jaipur but from Pakistan. Hanuman Chalisa is also not being recited in the video. Hence the claim being made by social media users is false and misleading.
