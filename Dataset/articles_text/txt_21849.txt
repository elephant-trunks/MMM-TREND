Did National Geographic magazine dedicate its "Winter 2020" edition to the agitating farmers?



An image that looks like a magazine cover with "National Geographic" written on it, along with a picture of a man wearing a turban, has gone viral with the claim that the cover story of the magazine features the ongoing farmers' protests at the Delhi border.

Several Facebook and Twitter users have shared the image and thanked National Geographic for the gesture.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the said cover image is actually an imaginary artwork by an Instagram user. The National Geographic has not featured the farmers' agitation as a cover story in any of its editions till now.

The archived versions of the posts are saved here, here and here.



The truth

We looked thoroughly through the National Geographic website, but could not find any recent article or cover image highlighting the farmers' agitation in India.

Rather, the recent editions of the magazine feature issues that are not even remotely related to the farmers' protests.

Looking carefully, we found "@anoopreet" written at the right-hand bottom corner of the image. Searching through social media, we found the user's Instagram account.

On January 3, 2021, she had posted this "imagined cover", mentioning clearly that this is her artistic creation based on a photograph clicked by photojournalist Ravi Choudhary of PTI.

Ravi Choudhary had posted this picture on Instagram on December 27, 2020, with the caption, "The Green revolutionaries of 2020!"

Hence, it is confirmed that the viral image circulated with the claim that it is the cover image of National Geographic magazine is actually an artwork of an Instagram user. The magazine has till now not featured the protest on the cover of any of its editions.
