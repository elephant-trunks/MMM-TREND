Social media is flooded with pictures of an ATM lying open, with loads of shredded currency notes. Netizens are calling it a "surgical strike on ATM" or "the return of demonetisation part II".

We have heard and read reports of ATM loots quite often, and then the miscreants are caught by the police with the help of CCTV camera installed inside the kiosk.

This time an ATM kiosk in Tinsukia, Assam was witness to a plunder which wasn't caught on any CCTV camera.

Rs 2000 and Rs 500 notes worth more than Rs 12 lakh were found torn in the SBI ATM machine in Laipuli area of Assam's Tinsukia.

According to SBI officials, this ATM was not functioning for more than two weeks.

On June 11, the technicians were shocked to find torn notes when they opened the machine for repairing.

SBI's ATM channel Manager Chandan Sharma claimed that this ATM machine was loaded with Rs 29 lakh before it broke down. "Nearly Rs 17 lakh are left untouched. Rest of the money -- Rs 12.38 lakh has been damaged," said Sharma.

SBI had lodged a police complaint in the local police station. Police began investigating into the case immediately.

Just as the police were at a loss to find any clue about the incident, the discovery of dead rodents from inside the ATM made the case easy.

Unbelievable as it may sound but rodents chew up currency more than Rs 12 lakh.

But this is not the first case of its kind. A few months ago, two mice were caught on video in an ATM of Astana, Kazakhstan. Reports suggested that around $300 were destroyed by the mice.
