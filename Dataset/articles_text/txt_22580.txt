BJP MP Sadhvi Pragya has apologised in Lok Sabha for calling Mahatma Gandhi's killer Nathuram Godse a "patriot". But the controversy refuses to die down on social media.

Some Facebook users now claim that actor Akshay Kumar has demanded that Godse's final statement, clarifying why he killed Gandhi, be included in history books. Using a screenshot of a tweet, netizens claim it was posted by the Bollywood superstar.

The Hindi tweet, supposedly posted by Twitter handle @kumarakshay_1, translates to, "I am not getting into whether Godse killing Gandhi was right or wrong, but I will surely say that history books, apart from teaching that Godse was Gandhi's killer, should also teach his final statement on why he committed the murder. The next generation would decide whether it was right or wrong."

Here's the Facebook post.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the post to be false. The Twitter handle in question is not the actual Twitter handle of Akshay Kumar and the tweet has been falsely attributed to the actor.

Facebook user "Aradhana Singh Chauhan" made the post on a group called "WE SUPPORT NARENDRA MODI". The group has almost 29.2 lakh members. The archived version of the post can be seen here.

The viral post has been shared by several Facebook users such as "Antu Tiwari" and "Nagendra Kumar Chauhan". Several users believed it to be an actual tweet by Akshay Kumar. But the actor's verified Twitter handle is @akshaykumar.

The viral tweet is from Twitter handle @kumarakshay_1, which has now been suspended.

Akshay Kumar has never tweeted anything about Nathuram Godse, and there is no credible news report which has attributed a Godse quote to him, so far. Therefore, it is clear that the viral post is from a fake Twitter account and not the real Twitter handle of Akshay Kumar.
