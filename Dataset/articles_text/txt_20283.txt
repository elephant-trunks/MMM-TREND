A video is getting viral all over the social media sites in which the MLA of Nepal is claimed of criticizing Narendra Modi and his government.

In this video of 4 minutes, he can be seen ranting about the amount spent on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for himself and how much amount he provided to a different country. Also criticizing him and his government in every aspect.

Many users on social media shared this video using different captions.

A Facebook user writes, “Every Indian must listen to what the Nepal MP said about Modi in the Nepalese Parliament.

There are discussions all over the world about the wasteful expenditure of the thrower and the starvation of the country, our media is engaged in praise.(translates Hindi)

Many Facebook users shared the same video with the same caption.
