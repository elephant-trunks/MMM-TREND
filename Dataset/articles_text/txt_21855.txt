A screenshot, apparently of Pakistan's leading English newspaper "Dawn" is viral on social media. The headline of the report, dated June 10, 2020, says, "Pilot caught Pissing in the cockpit of PAF F-16 said urine increases efficiancy of Jets told by Allah in his dream."

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the screenshot is photoshopped. Neither is the incident true nor has "Dawn" published any such article.

Errors in headline gave it away

Grammatical and spelling errors, and deviations from Dawn's style in the headline raised doubts. We then searched for the content, but could not find any report either by Dawn or any other Pakistani newspaper regarding a pilot urinating in a F-16 cockpit.

Interestingly, on June 10, 2020, the same date mentioned in the viral screenshot, Dawn had debunked another fake news on F-16 in its name. The image in this debunked screenshot is the same which is going viral now.

Here are a few errors in the viral screenshot:

1. Apart from proper nouns, several other words in the headline start with upper case.

2. The word "efficiency" is misspelled as "efficiancy".

3. News reports normally prefer "urinating" over "pissing" and "says" over "said". The sentence stretches on devoid of a few words.

4. Full stops are not used at the end of a headline.

Coming to visible deviations from the "Dawn" style, while the real website uses "serif" font, the viral screenshot has used "sans serif" font. The author name, date, line serving to separate the headline and author's name, as well as navigation bars and advertising space below the "Dawn" logo, are missing in the viral screenshot.

Here is a comparison:

Hence, it is clear that the viral screenshot of a "Dawn" report claiming a Pakistani pilot was caught urinating inside the cockpit of a fighter jet is false.
