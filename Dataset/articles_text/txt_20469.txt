Russian Army has lost 10% of its combat forces in the war against Ukraine. During the arming, the defence ministry of Russia has released hypersonic missiles to Ukraine.

Jack Posobiec host to Human Events Daily and a verified account posted a video of an airstrike and claimed it was a sight of a hypersonic missile released by Russia.

The claims were getting viral from March 19, 2022

Fact check

After doing the reverse image search, we got to know that the video is old and does not share a relationship with Russia’s missile release.

The video was uploaded on Tik-Tok by the user named Alexander Krindlo on March 3, way before the time of the news hypersonic missile came into existence.

Conclusion: Therefore the video is misleading.

Claim review: Fake video of the Russian Missile attack in Ukraine got viral.
