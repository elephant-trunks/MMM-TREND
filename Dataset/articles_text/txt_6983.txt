The row over remarks against the Prophet Nabi by BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma refuses to die down even after days. Despite diplomatic pressure from several Muslim nations, protests have erupted in several states, resulting in police action.

Among the videos and photos that are shared on social media of the protests, there is an image of a group burning an upturned Indian Tricolour.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The photo was taken from Pakistan's Lahore on June 9 during a protest by religious groups over Sharma's remarks.
