FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the post, and found it to be old.

While looking for similar posts, we found that a Facebook user shared the same picture in March 2020.

Moreover, the sub-heads of the report mentioned the ‘6th JPSC PT‘ result. The exam for the same took place in 2016 and the first set of results was declared in 2017.

We then ran a keyword search and found a report by Dainik Bhaskar five years ago (2017), mentioning that after the results were declared, candidates protested outside the JPSC office against the passing of general category students in PT, who scored lesser marks than the reserved category students.

As per the report, the students said that the general category students, who scored 210 marks, were passed in PT, while those who got 259 marks from the reserved category failed.

We also found a report by Live Hindustan, dated June 7, 2021, mentioning that the recruitment process for the 6th JPSC PT, which started in October 2016, got completed in April 2020, due to an issue with the result.

On searching further, we also found reports dated February 2022, stating that ‘The Jharkhand High Court has scrapped the final result of the Sixth Combined Civil Services examination, conducted by Jharkhand Public Services Commission (JPSC) in 2016, rendering the appointment of all 326 successful candidates null and void’. The reports can be seen here and here.

Hence, it is clear now that the viral article clipping is old and not related to the 2021 results, which were announced recently.
