This is not a CG Robo made for film fictiom. It’s real US Delta force “Robot” Training practice used in yesterday operation to kill Terrorist Al bagdi in Syria.

Hats off to these soldiers taking part in the demo with live amunition. Total faith in the robot …using AI, Machine Learning…Technology is scary.
