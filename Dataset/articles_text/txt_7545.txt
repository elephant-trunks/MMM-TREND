Diego Maradona’s funeral procession today.

#DiegoMaradona’s funeral procession today.

Mesmerizing.

What does it indicate ?

A man par excellence.

He is neither a president nor a prime minister of any country.

His performance in football ground spoke for him.

So much of Love, adulation & respect who gets these days ?

He will remain immortal in the hearts of football fans.

Maradona..U have gone now in the safe hands of God, but whole football fraternity will remember U as ” God of Football” like our own living legend Sachin Tendulkar as ” God of cricket”

Maradona..Bravo

May your soul rest in eternal peace in the lap of Almighty.

🙏🙏🙏
