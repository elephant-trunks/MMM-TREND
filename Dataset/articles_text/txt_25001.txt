Spread the truth:

A video showing empty chairs placed for an event with just a handful people around is viral. It’s been tweeted by prominent people making fun of PM Modi that he is so popular that people are not coming to listen to his speech.

Supreme court lawyer Prashant Bhushan tweeted –



“प्रधानमंत्री की गुजरात में विशाल चुनावी रैली। उनकी बढ़ती लोकप्रियता का प्रतीक! “

Translation: “Prime Minister’s Grand Election rally in Gujarat. A sign of his growing popularity”

Truth

The Viral video is misleading, it was taken after the event was over.

The viral video is taken by someone from his/her mobile/camera as it can be seen shaking. It’s been taken after the event is over, people can be seen leaving the location. The recorded speech is being played on the LEDs installed on the side.

And also in the viral video, a crowd can be seen n the LED itself.

Below is a Five hour long video of the complete event where you can see the PM delivering his speech and crowd on the ground.
