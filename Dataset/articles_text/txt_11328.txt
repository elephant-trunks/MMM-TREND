Amidst the ongoing police tussle over the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput and the handing over of the investigation to the CBI, a claim is being made on social media through sensational news that the DGP of Bihar, Gupteshwar Pandey has resigned from his post. Maurya News18 was the first to publish this news on social media, through which it has claimed that it came to know from Delhi sources that DGP Gupteshwar Pandey has submitted his resignation to the Union Home Ministry through the Government of Bihar on Saturday 22 August 2020.
