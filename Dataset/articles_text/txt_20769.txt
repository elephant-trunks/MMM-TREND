A video of men vandalizing a hall is being posted on social media with the claim that since the farm laws have been repealed, people have been vandalizing places to express their rage.

The people can be seen thrashing chairs and tearing off banners in the video.

Fact-Check:

Upon reverse searching the key frames, we found that the same videos were posted by various news channels in January,2021. As per reports, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khatter was supposed to attend a programme in Karnal which was then protested by the farmers. Below is a video of the same covered by Quint.

Since the video is old, this claim is misleading.
