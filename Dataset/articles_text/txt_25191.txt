Truth

The claim is FALSE. Neither is the video from Pakistan nor is the man a coronavirus survivor. By using reverse image, an article published by Al Jazeera came up on this incident. According the article, the deceased man was a 46-year-old Sari Salem Wardat.

The article also mentioned the incident took place in Amrawah, a town near Jordan’s capital Amman. Sari was not a COVID-19 survivor, but an inmate who was released early as the government ordered release of prisioners to avoid crowding in prisons as a method to prevent coronavirus. In addition to that, no media report claim that he was a leader of any sort.
