Facebook

The same image is being circulated with a sarcastic comment – “First submarine bus or world’s first under water bus launched in Delhi”, to mock the Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. This is being forwarded after 1st rains in Delhi today.

This video is viral also in which the water has even entered the public bus

Ajay Sherawat (Spokesperson @bjp4delhi , National Media Incharge @bjp4India OBC Morcha.) tweeted

“केजरीवाल के लगातार संघर्षो के कारण आज दिल्ली के घरों में ही नही बसों में भी पानी।“

Translation: “Due to Kejriwal’s long fights, the water has entered not only the homes but even in the busses in Delhi”

Truth

The images are real but are old and not current as claimed.

There has been news on waterlogging in Delhi due to first rains recently but none of the reports carry the forwarded images.

Below attached is a tweet by ANI, reporting about the heavy rainfall outside 7 LKM Delhi.

#WATCH | Delhi: The national capital receives heavy rainfall, visuals from outside 7 LKM. Southwest #Monsoon has covered the entire country, including Delhi. pic.twitter.com/ddVh5Y2QtM — ANI (@ANI) July 14, 2021

This is a recent tweet by TOI reporting waterlogging opposite new Supreme Court building in Delhi.

This is a recent image of waterlogging in ring road near ITO as reported by Times of India today.

None of the reports included the Minto bridge Delhi, whereby the bus incidents took place last year or year before. Hence, the images are misleading, being wrongly linked to mock the Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Video

This video was viral last year too during rains in Delhi, it was mostly made viral by Congress supporters and ministers.

The video was from Jaipur, Rajasthan, not Delhi.
