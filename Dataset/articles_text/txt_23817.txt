NDA or UPA?ByPrachi SalveLoading...|25 Sept 2013 5:08 PM ISTXThere have been charges and counter-charges between the Congress-led UPA and the BJP-led NDA about the progress (or lack of it) of road projects during the last few years.     While BJP claims that road building has come to a virtual stand-still under the UPA, the Congress is countering that more projects are being executed under their regime.     Here is a quick fact check on only one aspect – national highways - of the 3.3 million kms road network in the country.     As the table below shows, the national highways network increased from 49,585 kms in 1999 to 65,569 kms in 2004 – an increase of 15,984 kms during the NDA regime which lasted five years.     And the NH network  under the UPA increased from 65,569 kms to 79,243 kms as of today – an increase of 13,674 kms from 2004, which is nine years.
