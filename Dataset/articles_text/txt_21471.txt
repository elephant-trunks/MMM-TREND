As Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with US President Joe Biden in the White House on Friday, two photos of anti-Modi demonstrators holding placards comparing Modi with Adolf Hitler went viral on social media.

Multiple Twitter and Facebook users have posted these images with the claim that anti-Modi protests were held in the US during Modi’s visit and the media is deliberately not reporting on these demonstrations.

India Today Anti Fake News War room ( AFWA) has found that the viral images are from 2019, when PM Modi had visited the US and met with former US President Donald Trump. Though the ‘Howdy Modi’ event in Houston had witnessed a huge support for Narendra Modi, some protests against him were also reported from Houston.

OLD IMAGES FROM ANTI-MODI PROTEST

With the help of reverse image search we have found both the images of the anti-Modi protest on social media dated back to 2019.

Multiple users have posted these images on Facebook and on Twitter on September 23 and 24, 2019.

It is true that these images did not get space on the mainstream Indian media during that time. But multiple websites and news portals had written about them and published photos about these protests.

According to these websites, protesters had gathered during Modi’s visit to the US in Houston in 2019. These protesters showed up with anti-Modi placards and raised slogans on various issues like Kashmir and abrogation of Article 370.

Some blog sites like Shaktish.blogspot.com have posted more images and videos of the protest that took place on September 22, 2019 in Houston. The viral images can also be seen in these images and videos published by the blog site.

As per an Al Jazeera report, during PM Modi's 2021 visit, dozens of Indian-Americans had gathered at Lafayette Square, the park in front of the White House, to protest against the visit.

But the viral pictures showing anti-Modi posters are from 2019 and not related to Modi’s recent US visit.
