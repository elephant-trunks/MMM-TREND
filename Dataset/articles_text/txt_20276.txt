A video is going viral on social media. It can be seen in this video that there is a very high snow covered hill, clouds are surrounded all around this hill. Which can also be seen from an airplane. Users sharing this video are claiming that this video is of Mount Kailash.

Posting this video from Facebook account named ‘Amritsar Shri Balaji Dham‘, caption- “Amazing view of Kailash. You’ve never seen it before”.

At the same time, Nageshwar Chauhan also captioned – “Amazing view of Kailash. You’ve never seen it before”.

Fact Check

We reverse searched the frames of the video to check the viral claim. On searching, we found a link to a video published on YouTube. This video has been published on JOSH RAWLIN YouTube channel “JOSH RAWLIN” on 7th April 2018. According to this channel, this video is from the famous Fuji hill of Japan. It looks exactly like the viral video that can be seen from 4.08 minutes to 4.14 minutes of the video uploaded on YouTube.

After we gathered more information about the Fuji Hill video, we found a ‘GIPHY GIF’ video on reddit.com. This video is what is going viral. It is written in the caption of this video- “Mt. Fuji cloud sweep”.
