Amid the escalating political crisis in Maharashtra, a video of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been circulating on social media with the claim that the CM called Mughal emperor Aurangzeb a martyr.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that Thackeray was talking about a Kashmiri soldier named Aurangzeb who was murdered in 2018, not the Mughal emperor.
