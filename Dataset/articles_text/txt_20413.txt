After Bhagwant Singh became the Chief Minister of Punjab and Arvind Kejriwal claimed that the development of Punjab can be seen within 10 days of his tenure. There has been much news involving both of them on social media.

Praveen Srivastava posted a picture of Arvind Kejriwal & Bhagwant Singh having dinner along with a man. For the dinner, chicken and alcohol are served and the user is making comments on the development of Punjab.

Many other users are also posting the same viral picture and raising questions about the development of Punjab by pointing out alcohol in the picture.

Fact check

After doing the reverse image search, we found that the image got viral in the year 2021. When Delhi CM and Bhagwant Singh were invited to a dinner by a driver of an auto-rickshaw.

TOI Chandigarh posted the video of both of them while having dinner at the house of the driver in the tweet on 22 November 2021.

In the report of TOI, we can also see the viral picture and found no such things as chicken or alcohol served in the dinner. Therefore, the picture is photoshopped.

Conclusion: Hence proves that the claim is misleading.
