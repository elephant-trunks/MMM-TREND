Truth

Firstly, the bill has been introduced as of now and not been passed by the US senate. There are no legal evidences supporting the removal of Dr. Fauci.

The following video discusses how the US stopped “Gain-of-Function” researches since the reign of Barack Obama. The Gain-of-function research refers to deliberately creating viruses to study their implications. Hence, there is no proof as to whether Covid-19 virus is man made or not.

The video also contains footage of Dr. Fauci testifying in front of US Republic senate members that their claim is absolutely wrong and he is fine with any kind of investigate to be conducted.

The screenshot below is of the article published by Newsweek on June 4 2021, contains Joe Biden’s statement saying that he is very confident of Dr. Fauci and not bothered by the false claims made.

Further the searches still show Dr. Anthony Fauci as the director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease – NIAID

Several fact checking sites such as India Today’s Anti-Fake News War Room, OneIndia, Factly and others verified that the news is fake and Dr. Anthony Fauci continues to be the director of NIAID and national adviser on health for the US president.
