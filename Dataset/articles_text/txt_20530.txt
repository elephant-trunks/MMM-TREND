Amid the 10th day of the war, heavy fighting and shelling continue on the borders and different parts of Russia and Ukraine.

Russia has declared a full-scale invasion of Ukraine which has resulted in displacing over 1 million people on February 24th. Meanwhile many fake news is coming forward on the situation diverting the people on social media by not showing the real picture of the scenario.

A video teaching how to drive abandoned and captured trucks is getting viral on social media. There is a girl shown in the video who is actually teaching the masses about how to drive the vehicle.

@JoshuaPotash writes on Twitter, “The future is a very weird place. Ukrainians are uploading videos on TikTok about how to drive abandoned or captured Russian military vehicles.”

Fact Check:

By digging into the video more by Reverse Image Search. We found that this video is from February 2021. Hence, not of the recent times. The girl in the video is also not from Ukraine.

We too found the Instagram handle of the girl named tymannastya. Shttps://dfrac.org/hi/?p=10430&preview=truehe has posted this video on her reels section which she reposted again 4 days ago. It was very prominent from her account that she is into cars and most of her videos are like this only telling people about different vehicles.

Conclusion:

The video is not from recent times but from the year 2021.

Claim Review: Ukrainians uploading videos on Tik-Tok teaching how to drive abandoned and captured vehicles.

Claimed by: @JoshuaPotash , @SharonsRose13 and other social media users.

Fact Check: Misleading.
