A screenshot is getting viral on social media sites in which it is written just below the picture of Yashwant, ‘Breaking: Will pass an order to arrest Nupur Sharma soon after taking oath as President of India: Yashwant Sinha’ (Translates Hindi). People all over social media are claiming this statement to be true.

A user on Facebook writes, “Is he also from this earth Or someone is thrown from Mars..”(Translates Hindi)

A Twitter user writes, “Whose punctured tube is this??????”

Fact Check:

First of all, we searched his verified Twitter handle of Yashwant Sinha. We found his tweet dated July 2, 2022, in which he referred to Nupur Sharma’s case and criticized BJP. He also asked Narendra Modi whether he is going to say something on this matter or not?

ऑल्ट न्यूज़ के मोहम्मद ज़ुबैर को ये कहकर जेल में बंद कर दिया गया कि वो देश में वैमनस्य फैला रहे हैं। लेकिन भाजपा की एक प्रवक्ता, जिसने जहर फैला दिया इस देश में, उसके खिलाफ अभी तक कोई कानूनी कार्रवाई नहीं हुई। क्या प्रधानमंत्री जी इस पर कुछ बोलेंगे? pic.twitter.com/Sv5UOgGaQ7 — Yashwant Sinha (@YashwantSinha) July 2, 2022

But, found no statement like that on his account.

We also found a report on Indian Express with the headline, “Yashwant Sinha writes: India had won global respect. The Nupur Sharma row has dented it.”

But again, we find him nowhere speaking the viral claim.

Conclusion:

DFRAC through the research found this information to be misleading as no such statement was given by Yashwant Sinha.

Claim Review: Yashwant Sinha said that Nupur Sharma will get arrested after he becomes President.

Claimed by: social media users.

Fact Check: Misleading.
