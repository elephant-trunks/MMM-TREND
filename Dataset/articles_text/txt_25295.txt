Spread the truth:

2019 started off with two things: an upbeat sentiment towards the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, and the recent #10YearChallenge which has just started off on Social Media, which challenges people to post two photographs of themselves ten years before and a current one. Our political parties have taken a step forward in comparing the actions of their rivals with the same challenge.

Day before Yesterday official twitter handle of BJP Karnataka tweeted an image with “#10YearCallenge Modi style ! 😎” with “Nation with Namo” logo and by now had 838 Retweets

The image has a set of 6 photos, three on left under 2009, and three on right under 2019 explaining how much has changed in last 10 years under the Narendra Modi government.

Also, Facebook page Nation With Namo posted the image with the hashtag #10YearChallenge.

This post has six images which show India in 2009 and India in 2019. This post has been put up on their Facebook and Twitter accounts

This post has had 4800 likes and approx 3000 shares so far.

This article talks about Swalia Bibi, a slum dweller in Bhubhaneshwar, the capital of Odisha, and the 20th Million beneficiary of the Prime Minister Ujjwala Yojana cooking gas distribution scheme, who is not able to afford LPG cooking gas cylinders because of the steep rise in monthly expenditure.

Image 5 (Bottom Left): 2019

This image is a representational photograph which first appeared in an NDTV article in 2011 which talks about the usage of solar power to electrify villages in Bihar’s West Champaran district.

This photograph has also been used as a representational image for many other articles and journals which talk about the generation of electricity.

This isn’t the first time, last time on completion of 2 years, the official Government handle also used such fake image to show development. They used Africa’s photo claiming to be old photo of India
