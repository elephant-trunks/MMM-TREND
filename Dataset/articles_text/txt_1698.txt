For the first time in my life I felt like we are going to die. We got trapped into the fire 🔥 . Thank you God for saving us 🙏.

On this video I speak Russian. Mostly I am just praying. I am too emotional. I am sorry.

I just wanted to tell you, Love, Live and be grateful for every day of your life! ❤️
