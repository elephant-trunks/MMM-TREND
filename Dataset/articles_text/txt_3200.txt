The tweet by the handle @Moeen_Ali18 reads: “If India does not apologise for its blasphemous statement, will never go to India to play again, I will also boycott the IPL. And will appeal to my fellow Muslim brothers to do the same.

I Love Muhammad P.B.U.H”

After searching @Moeen_Ali18, which made the original tweet, we found that the Twitter handle had been suspended at the time of filing this report.

Upon extracting the archive version of the Twitter handle, we found that the Twitter handle was a parody account in the name of cricketer Moeen Ali.

The bio stated that it is “Not Official #Newsfeed -Commentary Account of #MoeenAli”

Meanwhile, upon a keyword search, we did not find any official report/statement about the English cricketer making this statement. It is to be noted that Moeen Ali does not have any official social media handles.

Recently, Ali visited India for the 15th edition of IPL as he plays for Chennai Super Kings.

In conclusion, the above finds prove that Moeen Ali did not boycott IPL and he did not react to the controversial remarks on Prophet Mohammad.
