BJP leader Amit Malviya shared a 16-second video of Delhi’s CM Arvind Kejriwal. In the video, Kejriwal can be heard mentioning that people shall sing the National Anthem by raising the flag on the eve of 14th august (One day before Independence Day).

In response to this BJP leader writes on Twitter, “14th August? Arvind Kejriwal is sinister and evil. He is playing to a constituency, knowing fully well that India got its independence on 15th August. But we understand why those who supported ‘Jinnah Wali Azadi’ in Shaheen Bagh would want to celebrate it on 14th August.”

Fact Check:

To check the authenticity of the video, the DFRAC desk used specific key frames and found the full video on News 18 India In the entire video Kejriwal can be heard only speaking for India and no sentence of him is against it. In the video at 22 seconds, he clearly mentioned, “14th august an eve before our Independence Day”.

Conclusion:

The video is getting viral with a misleading claim that Kejriwal only mentioned 14th august to sing the national anthem by holding the flag, whereas, in reality, he mentioned the eve before our Independence Day i.e on 14th august we all shall gather together to sing the national anthem holding our National Flag.

Also, a cropped video is shared rather than the real one.

Claim Review: Kejriwal only mentioned 14th august to sing the national anthem by holding the flag.
