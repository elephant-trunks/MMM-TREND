Truth

The video is not of the Hathras gangrape victim.

Although we couldn’t trace back the video, to find the time or the lady in the video but she is not the victim.

First of all, The faces doesn’t match at all. We can’t show you the real un-blurred photo but you either might have seen it or can check on Google.

On the left is the lady from the video, while on the right is the victim.

Secondly about studies, the victim was a 19 year old girl but went to school only till Std. 5 as her Mother told Indian Express.

“She had to cross the highway just to get to the primary school. Trucks and buses moved at such speed… We pulled her out of school when she was in Class 5. We never let her go alone, we were afraid she might come under a car, or that someone might kidnap her… What we feared has come true. We couldn’t protect her,” says the woman’s mother, sobbing into her veil.”
