Since the nationwide lockdown came into force from March 25, Internet is full of videos of cops thrashing civilians on the streets. And now, a video of a man with white long hair getting beaten up by a couple of policemen has gone viral. Social media users were quick to conclude that it was filmmaker Sudhir Mishra who was at the receiving end of police high-handedness this time.

The video shows a few people standing in demarcated locations, while a man in white flowing hair arguing with policemen while they beat him up. The archived version of the post can be seen here.

The video has been shared with the same claim on Twitter as well as YouTube.



India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the man getting beaten up in the viral video is not Sudhir Mishra. In fact, the filmmaker tweeted and clarified that it was not him.

In a tweet, Mishra wrote, "I am quite amused that people think I would take a beating without reacting . Every tall white haired guy is not me . What shocks me is that the glee of the troll brigade . How sick ! Whoever that coward who takes a beating like that , it ain’t me , sickos ! Get a life !"

In another tweet, he said, "... By the way till date I’ve never had a problem with the police... I am sorry to disappoint you but that fat long john wearing fair guy with full hair at the back ain’t me ."





AFWA could not independently ascertain where the video is from or the identity of the man being thrashed by cops, but it is certain that the man getting beaten up was not filmmaker Sudhir Mishra.
