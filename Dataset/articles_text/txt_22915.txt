Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman's homecoming last week had sparked a social media frenzy. Not to mention, the hero pilot and his life have become subjects of interest to netizens. Among the many posts related to Abhinandan doing the rounds on social media, a recent post shows a woman and a boy posing with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The viral picture is captioned: "Abhinandan's wife & son with PM".

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be totally false as the woman and the child in the picture is not Abhinandan's wife and son. We found that it is election strategist Prashant Kishor's wife Jahnavi Das and their son with PM Modi in this viral photo.

We first looked for a picture of Wing Commander Abhinandan's wife on the Internet. Abhinandan's wife Tanvi Marwaha is a former IAF squadron leader. We found that Tanvi was present in Delhi when Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman visited Abhinandan after his release. A tweet by the defence spokesperson can be seen here.

A closer look at the photos clearly shows that the woman in the viral picture is not Abhinandan's wife.

An extensive search into social media profiling led us to Jahnavi Das. We checked the photo gallery of her Facebook page and found that she has posted a number of pictures with Prashant Kishor. Our Patna correspondent contacted Kishor and asked him to identify the woman and the kid in the viral picture. Kishor immediately confirmed that the woman and the boy in the picture are his wife and son. He said the picture was taken last year around Holi. "The family is surprised as to how this picture landed on social media," he added.

Abhinandan was handed over to India at the Wagah-Attari border after being in Pakistan's captivity for two days.
