A collage of two photographs is doing the rounds on social media, with the claim that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has paid tribute to the busts of Mahatma Gandhi as well as his killer Nathuram Godse.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. In the second picture, PM Modi is not paying tribute to Godse but Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, an RSS ideologue and former leader of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh.

A Facebook user 'Parwezalam Khan' shared this misleading post which has been shared almost 3,000 times.

A simple reverse search revealed the truth behind this post. We found an article of the International Business Times carrying the second image in which Modi can be seen paying tribute to a black bust.

In the article, the caption of the image says Modi along with other BJP leaders paying tribute to Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya on April 6, 2017. The picture was taken at the BJP headquarters in New Delhi on the 37th Foundation Day of the party.

In the viral post, the picture showing Modi paying tribute to Gandhi was clicked in Rajkot when the PM visited the Mahatma Gandhi Museum on September 30, 2018.

This is not the first time that these images have surfaced on social media with the false claim. Last year in May, similar misleading posts were viral and many, including India Today, fact-checked this.
