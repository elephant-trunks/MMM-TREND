A disturbing video of a girl being burnt alive by a mob is doing the rounds on social media. It is being claimed that the Hindu girl from Madhya Pradesh got punished for attending a prayer meet at a church.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim with the viral video is misleading. The video is from Guatemala and is about four years old.

The video, which is going viral both on Facebook and Twitter, is being shared by Pakistani users as well. It shows a girl who has been set ablaze in the middle of a road while a crowd looks on. A longer version of the video is also viral, which shows a mob beating up the girl before setting her on fire.

On reverse search, we found that the video is from an incident that took place in Rio Bravo, Guatemala, in May 2015. As per media reports, a 16-year-old girl was beaten and burnt to death for her alleged involvement in the killing of a taxi driver.

This video was viral in 2016 and then in December 2018 with similar claims. The Quint had reported about it last year.
