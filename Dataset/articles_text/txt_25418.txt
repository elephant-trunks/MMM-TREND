Spread the truth:

Was Rahul Gandhi reading a Kannada Newspaper ?

Rahul’s knowledge of reading Kannada language was questioned.

The photo was from relaunch of National Herald, a Congress newspaper. Rahul reading the paper on stage.

The advertisements on front page was in Kannada so the right wingers claimed entire newspaper to be in kannada.

This is a BJP MLA who tweeted –
