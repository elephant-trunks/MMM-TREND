FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the post and found it to be false.

We started our investigation by carefully examining the cover in the viral post. We found that unlike other TIME magazine covers, the cover in the post does not have the date of the issue as is always mentioned in the top right corner.

We further checked the TIME vault, a segment where the magazine keeps the archives of all its covers. We could not find the cover in the archive.

Moreover, in March 2022, NewsMobile debunked a similar cover depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin as Adolf Hitler.
