A postcard containing two photographs has gone viral criticising Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal.

The postcard contained the text, “Kejriwal’s Delhi model is getting replaced in Punjab.” The first photo was captioned, “Delhi Riots”. The second one was captioned, “Punjab Violence”.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that neither photo had any connection with Arvind Kejriwal or the AAP. While the first photo was taken during an anti-CAA protest in Bengaluru, Karnataka, the second one was an old photo from Punjab taken before AAP came to power in the state.

AFWA Probe

We reverse searched the first photo and found websites like OpIndia, the HinduPost, and Swarajya Magazine shared the photograph in December 2019. Both websites claimed that the photo was from an anti-CAA protest in Bengaluru, Karnataka.

We then searched for the second image on Tineye, a reverse image search engine. We found the photo shared as early as 2013.

an Urdu website in April 2018. Although we did not find the link to this photo in the first few search results, we found the same photo was posted byin April 2018.

This means that this photo was an old one and was taken before the AAP came to power in Punjab.

Hence, concluded that the claim in the postcard was misleading. Both photos had no connection with Arvind Kejriwal or the AAP.
