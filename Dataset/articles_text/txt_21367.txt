Two photos are going viral on social media with the claim that they show the recent ambush in Manipur that claimed the lives of seven, including Colonel Viplav Tripathi of the Assam Rifles.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that both the images are old and not related to the recent attack in Manipur. We did a reverse search of the first image of the burned convoy and found that it was shared by multiple news reports in 2015.

As per these reports, the image is from a militant attack that took place in Manipur's Chandel district in June 2015.
