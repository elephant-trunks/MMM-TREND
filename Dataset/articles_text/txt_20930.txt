School dropout rate in Gujarat less than one per cent: PM Modi — Press Trust of India (@PTI_News) September 11, 2021 Press Trust of India’s Tweet

Fact-Check:

On August 2, 2021, Union Minister of Education Dharmendra Pradhan, in an answer given in the Lok Sabha, said dropout rates are calculated considering both government and private schools to take care of inter school movements of students. In this, Pradhan mentioned state-wise dropout rates as per Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) 2019-20.

The latest data of UDISE+ is from 2019-20, which shows that the dropout rate for primary level (Grades 1 to 5) was 1%, for upper primary (Grades 6 to 8) was 5.2%, and secondary level (Grades 9 and 10) was 23.7%. Which clearly tells that out of every 100 students in Grades 9 and 10, over 23 students dropped out of school.

Further, the UDISE dashboard shows dropout rate for secondary level has increased by more than 3% in 2019-20 from 20.61% in 2017-18, and in the same period, dropout rate for primary level reduced from 1.67% to 1%.

Considering the data provided by UDISE+ the dropout rate is clearly not below 1% and hence to be considered as falsely claimed.
