Ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit to Ahmedabad, slums in Gujarat have become a controversial spot after mainstream media published news reports that Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has sent eviction notices to slum dwellers and has begun building walls allegedly to cover up slums on Trump's route.

The claim

Now a set of two images, claiming to be of Gujarat are going viral on Facebook.

One of the images which looks more like a digital graphic has the caption "Gujarat 2014".

The other picture shows a top shot of slumlike structures with a caption saying "Gujarat now".

User "Nimal C R" has posted this on the Facebook page.

The truth

India Today Anti Fake News War room ( AFWA) found this to be a misleading post. The viral images on Facebook are not from Gujarat.

With the help of reverse image search, we have found the original sources of both the viral images.

Viral Image 1

This viral picture was taken from a website "wallpaperflare.com". This wallpaper picture is not real but a graphical representation of a "Futuristic cityscape, green grass, fantasy" as described in the caption of the picture on the website.

Viral Image 2

This viral picture has been used several times on various news websites as a file photo for Mumbai slums.

"DNA" news website used it on June 12, 2016, on a news report on Mumbai slums.

Another website "Nyoooz.com" used the same image in a 2016 news report regarding "Brihanmumbai Municipal corporation".

Conclusion

Hence, it is clear that the viral images used in the post have no Gujarat connection.
