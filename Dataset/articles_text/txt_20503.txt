The war under the Ukraine-Russia conflict continued for 2 weeks now. Under the crisis, a short video is getting viral. In the video, users are claiming that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has sung a song for his wife.

Endless love Sung by: Pres. Volodymyr Zelensky & wife Olena for each other & for Ukraine pic.twitter.com/0uRXyiMnFO — David Bouchard (@davidbouchard) March 10, 2022

Felix Malsi is a user who posted a video of 4 minutes 28 seconds where a male singer along with the female singer is singing a song. He claimed that the singers are Ukraine President Zelenskyy and Ukraine’s first lady Olivia. He posted the video on March 9, 2022.

Fact check

After researching, we found that the singer’s original identity is Lionel Richie and Diana Rose. It is not Zelenskyy and his wife. The music video got released on February 20, 2022, on the official YouTube page of Boyce Avenue.

Nevertheless, President Zelenskyy’s wife is Olena Zelenska, and her original look does not match with the female singer.

Hence proving that the claim is misleading
