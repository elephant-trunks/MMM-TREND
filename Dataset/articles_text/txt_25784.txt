Amid the ongoing row over controversial remarks on Prophet Mohammad by suspended BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma, a video of a mob vandalising a temple is being shared on social media.

The caption of the post reads, “नूपुर शर्मा जी ने कुछ बोला हल्ला हो गया और ये जो कर रहे है वो क्या है 57 देशो से पूछता हूं”

(English Translation: Nupur Sharma ji said something and there was an uproar and tell me what is happening in 57 countries)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim and found it to be MISLEADING.

Using the InVid Tool, we extracted keyframes from the video and performed a Reverse Image Search. The search directed us to a news report published by The Times of India on August 5, 2021, that carried the same visuals. According to the report, “A frenzied mob attacked a Hindu temple in Bhong city in Rahim Yar Khan district of Pakistan.”

Searching further, we found a video news report published by Hindustan Times dated August 5, 2021, that carried the same viral video. The video description reads, “Watch: Hindu temple attacked in Pakistan, mob rampage on camera; India slams Imran government.” The Free Press Journal also reported the same incident back in 2021.

After the incident went viral in 2021, then Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan’s office ordered an investigation into the vandalism of a Hindu temple.

NewsMobile debunked the same video in March 2022 when it was shared as a temple being vandalised in Bangladesh.

Hence, we can conclude that the video is old and is being shared with a misleading claim.
