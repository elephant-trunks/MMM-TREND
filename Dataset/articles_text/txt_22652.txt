On his 150th birth anniversary, Mahatma Gandhi has been entangled in a web of dodgy news on social media. An image of Gandhi that apparently captured the moment he was killed by Nathuram Godse is going viral. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false and misleading.

The claim

On October 1, Facebook user 'Sat Ram' posted an image showing a man lying on the ground while another leans over him. Behind, one youth is seen held by two men by the arms.

The caption of the image reads, "A rare Pic of Mohatama Gandhi's Murder -- Hindu extremist RSS worker Nathuram Godse, the man who killed Gandhi, - was held by two Hindus while the dead body of Gandhi is lying on the floor . (30 Jan 1948). RSS was immediately banned by Indian Authorities ."

The archived version of the post can be seen here.

Many other Facebook users such as Junoon Media have shared the post with the same claim.

AFWA probe

Upon investigating the origin of the image, AFWA found that a number of people commented in the comments section of the post, saying the image was taken from a movie.

Upon reverse searching the image, we found that it has been shared innumerable times by social media users. We got hold of a few links that led to a still image from the film 'Nine Hours to Rama'. It's a 1963 movie directed by Mark Robson. Here is the link of the movie.

Here is a still of Horst Buchholz who played the role of Godse in the movie.

The facial similarities of the actor with 'Godse' in the viral picture reconfirms that it is a still from 'Nine Hours to Rama'.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the re-enactment of the killing scene of Gandhi in a movie has been posted with a misleading claim. It is not an original image of the assassination of Gandhi, but only a still from 'Nine Hours to Rama'.

Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948 at Birla House in New Delhi, now known as Gandhi Smriti. It was here that he spent the last 144 days of his life.
