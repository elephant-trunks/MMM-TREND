From the above research, it is clear that the picture shared in the post is not of DSP Davinder Singh, but of CBI Deputy SP Devender Kumar who was arrested on corruption charges in 2018

Who is Davinder Singh:

On searching the keywords ‘DavinderSingh arrested’ on Google, we found a News published on India Today (Archive) on 13th January 2020, according to which DSP of Kashmir, Davinder Singh, has been arrested for being caught with terrorists.

You can see from the comparison of both the pictures, that both are different.

This discovery confirms that the photo shared in the post is of CBI Deputy SP – Devendra Kumar, arrested in 2018 on charges of corruption and not DSP Davinder Singh, who was recently arrested with terrorists in Kashmir. Both the picture and the name in the viral post are incorrect.
