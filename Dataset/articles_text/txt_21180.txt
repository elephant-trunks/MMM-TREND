Thousands of Ukrainian men have joined the country's defense force to fight Russia as the invasion rages on. Now, an image of two children saluting the Ukrainian army moving in tankers is viral on social media. It is claimed to be a recent image of children in Ukraine sending off the country’s army for war with Russia. The personnel can be seen waving hands at the children.

“This photo brought tears to my eyes. Two young Ukrainian children sending-off soldiers to fight the Russians. The kids holding hands, the girl holds a stuffed animal, the boy (her brother?) salutes. Look what he has on his back. This picture speaks a thousand words,” the caption to one such post read.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the image to be misleading. This image has been on the internet at least since 2016.

We did a reverse search of the image on Yandex and found the same image carried by multiple media reports from Ukraine in March 2016.

As per these reports, the image was released by Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence on its Facebook page. It was carried along with a bunch of other images that showed Ukrainian children with the country’s armed forces. Reports also said the images were part of a photo album titled “Children of War” by a photographer from Ukraine, Dmytro Muravsky.

We searched the verified Facebook page of Ukraine’s Minister of Defence and found the same image uploaded on March 22, 2016, with credit to Dmytro Muravsky.

A few of the other images from the album can be seen below.

Over the years, the image has been carried by multiple media outlets and blogs. We couldn’t independently verify whether the image in question was staged or digitally altered.

However, it is an old image that is unrelated to the current Russia and Ukraine conflict.
