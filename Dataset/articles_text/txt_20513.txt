A screenshot of CNN is going viral on the internet. The screenshot includes a picture of a man. His name is written in the screenshot is Ivan Kotchinski. Moreover, it is written that he is a former primary school teacher. He has been traveling throughout the city and taking care of unaccompanied minors. And, locals have started calling him “the Karkhiv Kid finder” for his seemingly supernatural ability to find young boys who don’t have anybody protecting them.

Similarly, many other social media users have posted this picture on their social media handle.
