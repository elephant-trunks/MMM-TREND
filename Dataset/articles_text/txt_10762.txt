As India’s COVID-19 cases continue to surge tremendously and phase 3 of COVID-19 vaccination for citizens over 18 years of age is set to begin from May 1st, a message claiming that recipients are getting infected with COVID-19 even after two shots of vaccines is being spread widely on WhatsApp. The message also has a list of do’s and don’ts like taking hot water baths, avoiding the use of ACs and staying in the sun for some time every day in order to prevent a COVID-19 infection.

The complete message is as follows:

“WHY PEOPLE ARE GETTING INFECTED EVEN AFTER TWO SHOTS OF VACCINES 🤔🧐

It is worth knowing the Reasons for getting infected even after taking two doses of Corona vaccine.

A second dose is to be taken 4 to 6 weeks (Covaxin) and 6 to 8 weeks (Covishield) after the first dose of a Corona vaccine.

Immediately after entering the body, the vaccine starts making antibodies. When antibodies are forming in our body, our IMMUNITY decreases, very much.

When we take another dose of vaccine after 4-6 Weeks/ 6-8 Weeks, our IMMUNITY Decreases even more at that time.

After 14 days of SECOND DOSE (4-6 Weeks/ 6-8 Weeks) antibodies are fully formed in our body, then our IMMUNITY starts increasing rapidly.

During this PERIOD, due to LOW IMMUNITY, the possibility of Corona virus entering our body is very high.

This leads to Corona infection.

🧐

So, it is very risky to go out of the house during this PERIOD, Even after taking two doses of vaccine, you can still become a victim of corona.

After half a month (from SECOND Shot)- 100 to 200 times IMMUNITY power is created in our body and only after that, you are safe.

There is a need to be careful and safe from the first dose to Two/Two and a half months…..

Hence, One Must wear masks

Get out of the house only if necessary. Take a bath with hot water.

Take special care of children and the elderly.

The African strain of this time catches the whole family together.

So, Stay alert and Safe for family’s sake.

However, Fact Crescendo found that the claim is misleading. Experts says that despite receiving the vaccine someone may still contract the virus but there is no study to support the statement that getting the vaccine itself increases the risk of COVID-19 infection. Also, a balanced and nutritious diet is recommended but there is no evidence to prove that consuming food and condiments like amla, cinnamon and oranges, as mentioned in the message, will prevent COVID-19 infection.

FACT CHECK METHODOLOGY

For the Fact Check, we first ran a Google search with relevant keywords and found a news report published on April 22, 2021 by Livemint with the headline “2-4 per 10,000 people infected after getting vaccinated, Covaxin works against mutant viruses: govt.”

The report has a statement made by the Director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences(AIIMS), Delhi, Dr Randeep Guleria. Emphasizing the need to wear masks even after getting vaccinated, Dr. Guleria explains that though one might get infected post vaccination but its severity would be reduced.

The report also states that Public Health experts have said that even after completing two doses, recipients should adopt COVID-19 appropriate behaviour.

Following this, Fact Crescendo got in touch with The Regional World Health Organization (WHO) representative for India who said “WHO does not have evidence that consuming certain food stuffs can protect from COVID-19 but WHO recommends having a balanced and nutritious diet in general.”

Wikipedia defines Immunity as a complex biological system endowed with the capacity to recognize and tolerate whatever belongs to the self, and to recognize and reject what is foreign

To know more about it, we got in touch with with Guwahati based Dr Balanuj Majumdar who has been treating patitents with COVID-19 infection who explained to us that immunity is the ability of an organism to resist a particular infection or toxin by the action of specific antibodies or sensitized white blood cells. He said that vaccines boost or increase the natural immunity of the human body to the particular disease. Immunity kicks in when our body detects infections or diseases that attack the body and activates the necessary antibodies required to fight them. He also stated that there are certain food items rich in vitamins and minerals that we can add to our diet which might help boost the immune system.

All the experts Fact Crescendo got in touch with, have suggested following all precautions like wearing a mask, maintaining physical distancing and the liberal use of sanitizers as preventive measures even after getting vaccinated. They have also suggested having a balanced diet and to ensure that there is no lack of essential nutrients which might lead to deficiencies, thus weakening our natural immune system.

CONCLUSION

Based on the opinion of the experts mentioned above, it can be inferred that a vaccine recipient may still contract the virus but there is no study that says getting the vaccine itself increases the risk of COVID-19 infection. Also, there is no evidence to prove that consuming food and condiments like amla, cinnamon and oranges, as mentioned in the message, will prevent COVID-19 infection.

We advise our readers to follow advice from medical professionals only regarding any doubts about vaccines and not to believe in unfounded rumours like these.
