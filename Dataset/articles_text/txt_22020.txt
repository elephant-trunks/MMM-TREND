India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The viral pictures were taken during the shoot of the movie "Dhara 370". Rakhi, who plays a Pakistani woman in the movie, had herself posted the pictures on social media last year.

The archived versions of the viral posts can be seen here and here. Multiple Facebook users have shared the same content.

With the help of reverse image search, we found several news reports regarding the pictures. As per these reports, Rakhi courted controversy in 2019 after posting the images on social media.

Netizens began trolling her overlooking the fact that she had clarified on Instagram that the pictures were taken during the shoot of "Dhara 370". Rakhi wrote, "I love my India but its my character in the film dhara 370."

She also posted a video on Instagram on the same day (May 8, 2019), showing the shooting scene and explaining that she is playing the role of a Pakistani girl in the movie.

Hence, it is confirmed that the viral images of the actor holding the Pakistani flag were taken during a movie shoot in 2019, and have been twisted on social media.
