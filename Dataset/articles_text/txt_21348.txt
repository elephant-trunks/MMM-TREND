A picture of a group of kids sitting inside a dilapidated structure is circulating on social media as the condition of a government school in Gujarat. The building is so worn out that a large chunk of the roof is missing and iron rods poking out.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the picture to be misleading. The picture is almost four years old and of a government school in Uttarakhand’s Almora district.
