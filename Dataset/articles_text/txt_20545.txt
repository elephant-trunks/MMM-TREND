Ukraine’s President decides to hold a peace talk with Russia. On the other hand, Putin escalates the tension on the course of East-West borders by ordering its Nuclear forces on high alert. The situation in Ukraine is critical as well as everything depends on the peace talk or negotiation over the NATO affair.

Under the war situation, many helping hands came up hence a claim over the Sikh community raising a helping hand is getting viral on social media. Atul Kumar Sharma posted a picture of a food truck and captions it as the initiative taken to serve food by the Sikh Community in Ukraine. The claim got viral on 26, February 2022.

Fact check

After seeing the picture and the claim, we researched further and found that the image is of sight in Canada. WeTheSikhs posted the same picture of a food truck in 2018. Through the user, we got to know that the food truck is Canada’s first free food and it works as Langar. Langar is a process through which a body serves free food to everyone irrespective of any religion, caste or creed.

Canada’s first Free Food Truck – Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s LANGAR – Goodbye Hunger. Everybody is welcome here regardless of Faith, Gender, Age, Caste or Status.#WeTheSikhs #Langar #GuruNanakDevJi #proudtobesikh pic.twitter.com/9chKbUAy19 — WeTheSikhs (@WeTheSikhs) August 6, 2018

Conclusion: Therefore the claim is misleading as the picture of the food truck serving is not of Ukraine rather the picture is of a food truck in Canada.

Claim Review: Sikh Community raised a helping hand by serving food in Ukraine.

Claim by: Atul Kumar Sharma
