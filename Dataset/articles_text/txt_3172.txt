Social media users are sharing images of Naga Sadhus carrying swords. The images claim that they are protesting in support of former BJP spokesperson, Nupur Sharma, who sparked the controversy over remarks on Prophet Mohammad.

The image is shared with a caption: “नागा साधुओं ने भी #नुपुरशर्मा के समर्थन का ऐलान कर दिया हैं कल्पना करिये उस दृष्य ” का जब “18 लाख” नागा साधु सड़क पर उतरेंगे। महा तांडव आपका स्वागत है,हर हर महादेव” (English translation: “Naga sadhus have also announced their support for #NupurSharma… imagine the scene when “18 lakh” Naga sadhus will hit the road. Welcome to Maha Tandav, Har Har Mahadev.”)
