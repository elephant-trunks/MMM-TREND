Mumbai: “National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has not published data on attacks in respect of separate categories of professionals, including journalists. However, information is being compiled.”

This was the reply by the minister of state for information and broadcasting Rajyavardhan Rathore to a question by Trinamool Congress leader Dinesh Trivedi on December 20, 2018.

The claim is false.

Fact: While the NCRB has not published data on attacks on Indians by profession, including journalists, according to this reply by minister of state for home affairs Hansraj Ahir to the Lok Sabha on December 18, 2018, the minister said cases were registered under sections 325, 326, 326A & 326B of the Indian Penal Code for attacks on journalists by various states and union territories.

(Section 325 deals with voluntarily causing grievous hurt while section 326 deals with causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means. 326 A and B refer to the use of acid either voluntarily or attempting to cause permanent or partial damage to a person.)

As many as 114 attacks were recorded in 2014, 28 in 2015 and 47 in 2016.
