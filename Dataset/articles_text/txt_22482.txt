A black-and-white photo of Mahatma Gandhi standing with a kid is going viral on social media with the claim that this was Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama as a child.

Facebook user "Siow Cheechoong" posted the photo in a group called "Dalai Lama Group" and captioned it, "Mahatma Gandhi and Little Boy One And Only Tibetan DALAI LAMA". The archived version of the post can be seen here.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the photo to be morphed. Though the kid is indeed Dalai Lama, but the viral picture was created by superimposing his childhood picture on the image of Mahatma Gandhi.

Many Facebook users have shared the photoshopped image believing it to be true. The photo has been viral on Internet for the last few years.

Upon reverse searching the viral photo, we found that it has been created by using two separate photos - one of Gandhi and the other of young Dalai Lama.

Picture of Mahatma Gandhi

We found this picture of Gandhi on "Getty Images". The picture was taken on November 3, 1931, when he visited Downing Street in London to attend a conference on Indian constitutional reforms. At that time, Dalai Lama was not even born.

Childhood photo of Dalai Lama

This photo is available on the website of "Dalai Lama" (https://www.dalailama.com/the-dalai-lama/biography-and-daily-life/birth-to-exile). As per the website, the photo was taken at Kumbum Monastery in Amdo, eastern Tibet, when Dalai Lama was only four years old. Dalai Lama was born on July 6, 1935.

Did Dalai Lama meet Mahatma Gandhi?

In 2007, the Hindustan Times quoted Dalai Lama as saying that he never met Mahatma Gandhi in his life but once saw him in a dream.

In 2017, Boom Live had also debunked this morphed photograph.
