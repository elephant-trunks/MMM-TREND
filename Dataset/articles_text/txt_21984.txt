As immense fighting rages on in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, a video clip of air attacks and counter ground defence has gone viral on Facebook with the claim that this is the video of how an Azerbaijani MiG-25 was shot down by Armenian forces.

Several Facebook users have posted the clip with the caption, “An Azerbaijani MiG-25 was shot down from the Armenian defences by the Shilka weapon. In Nagorny Karabakh, the Azerbaijani pilot did more than one manoeuvre to strike the ground defences of the Armenian air defence forces ... a fierce war”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is from a video game called ARMA 3.

The archived versions of the posts can be seen here and here. Several Facebook users have posted the clip with similar claims.

Some social media users, however, doubted the viral claim and commented that it is CGI (computer-generated imagery) and not the actual footage of an air attack.

With the help of InVID, we sliced up the viral clip into keyframes and using reverse image search, found that on August 22, a Japanese YouTube channel had posted the video. The video description when translated to English says, “A-10 Thunderbolt Warthog Thunderbolt CRAM Sius ARMA3 Arma 3”.

ARMA 3 is an open-world, realism-based, military tactical shooter video game developed and published by Bohemia Interactive.

India Today had earlier debunked a similar misleading claim where another ARMA 3 CGI video was passed off on social media as an original anti-missile Israeli defence system.

ARMA 3 videos can be modified and customised by gamers as per their own imagination, as told by its developer Bohemia Interactive to AFP Fact Check.

Hence, it is confirmed that the viral clip is not the original footage of the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. One such original video of the war can be seen here.
