Spread the truth:

A photo is being tweeted by Delhi BJP prominent people, questioning it, as while Delhi government has names Rs. 2000 as penalty for not wearing a mask for common man, and allowed only gathering of 50 people, why they themselves have invited 100s of children in a function without masks, making them prone to catch COVID19 virus.

Official @twitter Profile of Naveen Kumar Head Media Dept. @bjp4delhi #Spokesperson tweeted –

“दिल्ली सरकार के मंत्री @kgahlot जी कम से कम सिविल डिफेन्स के बच्चों के चेहरे पर मास्क तो लगवा देते #COVID19 को बिलकुल हलके में ले रखा हैं आपने तो ,न तो कोई सोशल डिस्टेंस हैं न किसी के चेहरे पर मास्क हैं | 2000 रु का चालान क्या सिर्फ आम जनता को परेशान करने के लिए हैं क्या..?“

Translation: “Delhi Government Minister K Gahlot should at-least have put masks on children of civil defense. You have taken COVID19 very lightly, neither maintained social distance, nor is there a mask on anyone’s face. Is Rs. 2000 fine only to annoy common people ?”

Truth

The photo in question is more than a year old. i.e. Before Corona pandemic spread in India.

The Delhi Minister they are blaming, K Gahlot, himself tweeted these photos on 28th October 2019.

He wrote “Historic Day for Delhi. With Hon’ble CM @ArvindKejriwal inaugurated the Training & Orientation of Newly Inducted Bus Marshals in DTC & Cluster Buses & announced for Free Travel for Women in buses from 29.10.19. This is the first of its kind model of Bus Marshals in the world“

He tweeted the same photos again 2 days ago as International Volunteers Day, remembering that event and thanking all civil defense volunteers. So people questioning these photos, took from this tweet without checking.
