There is a user named Shubham Tripathi on Twitter. According to his bio, he is an anchor and producer at News Nation. He tweeted a photo and claimed that the Muslim women in the burqa did not stand while the national anthem was sung.

Further, he wrote on Twitter- ” When ‘ National Anthem ‘ was playing, she didn’t stand up…then says “Everyone’s blood is included in the soil here. Eat here and sing for somewhere else.”

(“जब ‘राष्ट्रगान’ चल रहा था तो उस दौरान ये ख़्वातीने खड़ी नहीं हुईं….फिर कहते हैं “सभी का ख़ून शामिल है यहाँ की मिट्टी” में खाओ यहाँ का और गाओ कहीं का”)

Fact Check:

To investigate this photo, we did a simple search on Google. During this we got a report of “Jansatta” with the same photo. According to this report, this incident is from the meeting of the Municipal Corporation in Muzaffarnagar. The report has been given the headlines- ” Muslim woman councilor sitting on chair during Vande Mataram in Muzaffarnagar board meeting, created a ruckus ” .

This report shows that Muslim women did not stand during the Vande Mataram, not the national anthem.

Then, the question arises that whether is it necessary to stand on Vande Mataram ? when we tried to collect information, in this context, we came across a report published by Dainik Jagran in 2016. According to this report, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju told in the Rajya Sabha that no rule has been fixed for singing Vande Mataram.

Conclusion:

After fact checking, we found that Muslim women did not stand while the Vande Mataram was sung. They has not insulted the national anthem in any way. Hence, the claim being of Shubham Tripathi is misleading.
