A video of police firing tear gas shells on a group of protesters has gone viral on social media platforms. The video shot at night shows the police relentlessly firing tear gas shells to disperse a mob holding a candle march. The video is being actively shared on messaging platforms claiming police action on a group of Kashmiri protesters.

India Today Fact Checking team tried to find out the veracity of the video.

The video claiming to be from Kashmir raises doubts firstly because candle march protests are rare in the Valley. When the India Today team tracked the video down with the audio and listened carefully to the screams and conversations in the background, we could make out that the video is not from Kashmir.

So here's the truth.

Actually, the video was shot on the evening of July 19 in Imphal, Manipur. It was a torch rally organised by the Manipur University Students Union (MUSU) to press for their demands.

When the protesters reached Uripok area, they were met with police resistance. When the mob refused to retreat, police fired tear gas shells in which several protesters, including girl students, were injured.

Due to continuing protests by the MUSU for a over a month now, the administration has suspended internet services. However, such videos are actively shared on social media platforms despite the ban.

Our Fact Check investigation confirms that the viral video is not from Kashmir but from Manipur. The attempt to label a police action in Manipur as one from Kashmir is exposed as misinformation.
