In this Special Report, the focus is on the outrage following the Delhi High Court's decision to suspend the life sentence of former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in the Unnao rape case. The survivor and her mother were detained by Delhi Police while protesting at India Gate, sparking a political firestorm. Congress Spokesperson Dr. Shama Mohamad attacks the Modi government, asking, 'Why did the Delhi police arrest the victim? Let them protest.' In a significant intervention, BJP leader and former NCW Chairperson Lalitha Kumaramangalam also criticizes the police action and terms the High Court's judgment 'perverse,' stating the police had 'no business manhandling' the survivor. The discussion also covers the legal controversy over whether an MLA counts as a 'public servant.'
