We ran a keyword search and found an article by Amar Ujala from 2017, covering the same incident. The translation of the headline read, “Azam said Shri Ram-Krishna his ideal, in return asked question to CM Yogi.”

Based on this, we ran another search and also scanned for the original video. After an extensive search, we found the original video on the YouTube channel of the Samajwadi Party. The video was uploaded on October 7, 2017, with the description, “SP General Secretary Shri Azam Khan Speech in Agra, Rastriya Adhiveshan 2017.”
