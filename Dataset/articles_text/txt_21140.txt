A video of a man being brutally thrashed by others in the presence of policemen has been circulating on social media. The video was shared with the claim that it showed Bharatiya Janata Party members attacking an innocent man after the party’s record win in the recently concluded assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the claim along with the video was misleading. This video is from Bihar and was shot in 2019.

AFWA PROBE

We found the official Twitter handle of UP police's fact check unit responding to a post saying the video in question was from a 2019 incident in Bihar’s Kaimur district, and not related to UP.

Taking a cue from this, we ran a keyword search and found screenshots from the same video carried in an India Today report published on October 5, 2019.

According to the report, the video showed a ward councillor’s son, accused in a murder case, being attacked in the Shivaji Chowk area of Bhabua in Bihar's Kaimur district. He was accused of shooting a young man who later succumbed to his injuries in a city hospital.

The man was later admitted to Kaimur Sadar Hospital for treatment. Kaimur's SP told the media at the time that the deceased was shot over a private dispute with the perpetrator.

The Dainik Jagran, Live Hindustan, and News18 reported on the same story in October 2019.

According to these reports, the man being thrashed in the video was Shahid Rain. The young man he allegedly shot was Madhav Singh, a resident of Sikhathi village.

Reports also added that information about the death of the young man, however, made the public furious and there were attacks at hospitals where Shahid Rain was undergoing treatment. Several local shops were also attacked.

It is thus clear that the video in question is old and from Bihar. It has nothing to do with the BJP’s recent victory in UP assembly elections.
