A list with 64 names, blood groups and contact numbers is doing the rounds on social media claiming that it is the list of persons who are ready to donate Plasma in Mumbai for COVID-19 treatment. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.

The archived version of the post can be seen here.

Claim: Message with a list of persons ready to donate Plasma in Mumbai for COVID-19 treatment. Fact: Message with the same names was shared earlier in 2016 as the list of persons ready to donate blood. It is now being circulated as the list of persons ready to donate plasma in Mumbai for COVID-19 treatment. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.

When we searched on Facebook with a contact number in that list, it was found that the same list went viral in 2016. But the message then was shared as a list of ‘Blood donors ready to help’ unlike the current message that claimed it as the list of persons ready to donate plasma in Mumbai for COVID-19 treatment. The same message with the title as ‘Blood donors ready to help’ was also shared in 2017, 2018 and 2019.

When we tried calling a few numbers in that list for clarification, some of the numbers were out of service and the rest haven’t picked up calls. However, to be eligible for plasma donation, a person should have already been contracted with COVID-19 and recovered from it. But it is quite unlikely that the same set of 60+ persons whose names got circulated as ‘blood donors’ in the past were contracted with COVID-19 and are willing to donate their plasma to others.

To sum it up, a message shared as a list of blood donors in the past is now being circulated as ‘Plasma donors in Mumbai for COVID-19 treatment.
