Truth

The video is originally from the Jesolo Air Show 2019, in Italy. Jesolo Air Show is an event in Italy, where people gather together to watch the Air Forces displaying their strengths. The event gathers more than half a million people.

The video is a demonstration done by the ‘Frecce Tricolori’ done in the same airshow.

According to by the article by the ‘Italy Magazine, the ‘Freece Tricolori’, or the ‘Tricolour Arrows’, officially known as the 313° Gruppo Addestramento Acrobatico, Pattuglia Acrobatica Nazionale (PAN) Frecce Tricolori, is the aerobatic demonstration team of the Italian Air Force, founded in 1961.

The Italian Airforce posted this video on Twitter, and Instagram ( here ) on March 11, 2020, a day after the coronavirus quarantine started, to encourage the Italian people to “join forces”.

Their post, originally captioned in Italian, says: “Unity and teamwork have always been the principles on which our Armed Force is based and, at this moment more than ever, are fundamental. So, as the Frecce Tricolori have always done ‘let’s team up’ let’s join forces, together we’ll make it!”.

L’unità e il lavoro di squadra sono da sempre i principi su cui si fonda la nostra Forza Armata e, in questo momento più che mai, sono fondamentali.

Ed allora, come fanno da sempre le @FrecceTricolori ‘facciamo squadra’ 💪🏻, uniamo le forze 🏋🏻, insieme ce la faremo 🇮🇹! pic.twitter.com/s7tzRnD8Nl — Aeronautica Militare (@ItalianAirForce) March 11, 2020

As the video went viral. The Italian Air Force spoke to Reuters, confirming that the video was recorded on September 15, 2019, during the Jesolo Air Show.

The original video can be seen below.

The display video of the Frecce Tricolori, went viral in 2019 the claims, that, “India’s Independence day celebrated at Trafalgar Square, London with Tricolor in the sky.”

Factcheck revealed that there was a celebration of the Italian Republic Day on the 2nd of June every year at the Italian Parliament, popularly knows as ‘Piazza Venezia’ that features Italy’s Frecce Tricolori – the largest aerobatics display team in the world.

The celebration of 2018’s Republic Day was reported by The Telegraph in the United Kingdom and Euro News, a European pay television network. The entire article can be read here,

Therefore, it is established that the video is neither of the Indian Air Force paying tribute to the Coronawarriors in India nor did Italy put out an air show to lift the spirits of the Italians, it has to be noted that the Italian AirForce reshared the video so that people are motivated during these tough times and stay strong. The video is originally from an airshow from 2019.
