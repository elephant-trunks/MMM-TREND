A picture of a woman lying on a hospital bed is going viral on social media with the claim that she was raped by a doctor in a corona isolation ward and died soon after being discharged.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The teenage girl in the viral photograph was allegedly raped by a ward boy in a hospital in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, in June 2017.

As per media reports, the 16-year-old student was admitted to the intensive care unit of a private nursing home after she fell ill at a party.

The ward boy had asked her to change her clothes as they were wet. He then took her to the washroom and reportedly tried to force himself upon her. According to the complainant, the accused later drugged her and then raped her.

Gaya horror

However, another case has been reported in Gaya, Bihar, where a migrant woman admitted in a corona isolation ward was reportedly sexually abused by a healthcare worker.

According to media reports, the 25-year-old victim had returned to Gaya from Ludhiana in Punjab with her husband after an abortion.

The woman had complained of excessive bleeding after which she was admitted to Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital (ANMMCH) on March 27 in an emergency ward.

Later, it was suspected she might have been infected by coronavirus, following which she was shifted to the isolation ward. It was here that the incident took place. She was discharged from the hospital but died on April 6 due to excessive bleeding.

Therefore, it is clear that the viral image is around three years old and not related to coronavirus. However, a similar incident was reported recently from Gaya in Bihar.
