On Wednesday, an SUV sank into a crater caused by rains on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway.

As the news about the freak accident flashed on TV, another image of a shock road cave-in went viral on social media. This one targeted prime minister Narendra Modi.

The road caved in following a heavy downpour.

The photo had a stinging caption in English: "The world's first underground cricket stadium is ready in Benares (Varanasi), that too in the middle of a road. A 21-gun salute to Narendra Modi."

India Today Fact Check examined the image to determine whether it originated from the PM's constituency.

We looked for clues. Our search led us to a tweet from August 7, 2017, by Divya Spandana, the head of the Congress party's IT cell.

In that tweet, she used the same picture to attack the BJP government in Gujarat.

"NASA found a new crater on the moon, but later AMC confirmed it was a road in Ahmedabad/Amdavad," she jeered.



The AMC stands for the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. The picture Spandana posted showed the three letters printed both in English and Gujarati on the barricades surrounding the large sinkhole.

Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt tweeted the same photo on July 29, 2017. He also mentioned its location as Ahmedabad.

India Today's ground report confirmed that the crater developed near Swastik Chowk in Ahmedabad after a road collapse from heavy rains in July last year.

So, the sinkhole that went viral on Wednesday was nowhere near Varanasi both in distance and time.

But that doesn't exonerate authorities for poor conditions of roads in many parts of India.

Potholes are blamed for 2,324 from across the country in 2016, according to the Road Transport and Highways Ministry.
