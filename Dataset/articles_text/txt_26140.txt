A post on social media is going viral. It was claimed that Pfizer has developed a new Monkeypox vaccine.

One user tweeted that only to clarify… A case of “Monkeypox” was found in Massachusetts this week… In less than 48 hours, the U.S. government bought 13 million Monkeypox vaccines for $119 million. A day later, Pfizer received FDA approval for the New Monkey Pox vaccine.

Many other users have also made similar claims.

Fact Check:

During the course of investigation of the above claim, we found an article by the satirical website Babylon. The title is – ‘Pfizer announced that they did this yesterday to end the Monkeypox vaccine

It is worth mentioning that the website gave information in the About section, writing that Babylon B is the best satirical site in the world, which is completely flawed in all are true claims. We write satire about Christian content, political goods, and everyday life.

Julia Cohen, a representative for Pfizer, told Reuters via email: “Pfizer does not currently have a vaccine approved by the FDA for Monkeypox or for an active program. “

Apart from this, there has been no update on the Monkeypox vaccine from Pfizer on its website.

Conclusion

So, Pfizer’s claim to release the Mancapox vaccine and get it approved by the FDA is wrong.
