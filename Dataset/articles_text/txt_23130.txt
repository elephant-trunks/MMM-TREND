A video of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor is going viral after the Congress held its Chintan Shivir claiming that he was seen clapping and dancing to a Bollywood song, during the three-day meeting in Udaipur, Rajasthan, earlier this month. It’s being shared here and here.

FACT CHECK

However, we found that the video was not from Rajasthan but from Kerala as the background shows the name of Uma Thomas, written in Malayalam while the “UDF” marked in the background stands for United Democratic Front, an alliance of Congress-led political parties in Kerala.

Based on this, when searched in Google, we found that Tharoor himself shared this video on May 18 on Twitter, writing “My ‘Chambikko’ moment today (for translation, ask a Malayali!).” And the song playing in the background was not the Bollywood number, which was added later in the viral video being circulated now.

Hence, the video was not from Udaipur’s Congress Chintan Shivir but from Kerala from a different event, when he participated in the Thrikkakara bye-election campaign for Congress candidate Uma Thomas and danced with party workers.
