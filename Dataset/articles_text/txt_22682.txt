The new Motor Vehicles Act was implemented across the country on September 1. Since its implementation, several cases are being reported where traffic violators end up facing hefty fines.

Now, a video has gone viral on social media with the claim that after the implementation of new traffic rules, police are now illegally collecting fines from people by beating them.

The video shows some policemen with batons (lathis) in their hands, thrashing people on the road and taking them in a police jeep.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the claim with the video is false. The video is from Rajasthan's Alwar and it was up on the internet before the implementation of new traffic rules in the country.

The video is spreading like wildfire on social media.

Some YouTube channels have also shared the video with the false claim.

When we reverse searched the video with the help of In-Vid tool, we found some news reports regarding the viral video. A report in Patrika said that on August 27, the police had lathi-charged some protesters for questioning the counting of votes during the student union elections in Raj Rishi college in Alwar.

AFWA also found a YouTube video of Rajasthan Tak describing the same incident.

Therefore, it is clear that the viral video has nothing to do with the implementation of the amended Motor Vehicles Act in India.
