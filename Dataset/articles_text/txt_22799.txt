Was late-night partying by Pakistan cricketers hours before the crucial World Cup face-off against India the reason why they faced such a drubbing by Virat Kohli and boys in Manchester?

Well, many social media users in the neighbouring country feel so. A four-second video of some Pakistan cricketers sitting with friends and smoking hookah has attracted much ire by netizens.

India Today’s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the night-out was not before the match but two days prior to it, i.e. Friday, June 14.

After Sarfaraz Ahmed’s XI lost the match to India on Sunday evening, Pakistan-based journalist Murtaza Ali Shah tweeted, Shoaib Malik out on zero. At 2am on Sunday, he was at the Winslow Road sheesha bar with his wife and mates. This was the kind of preparedness against India. Where’s the mighty ehsan mani and IK’s promise of taking pak cricket to new heights in Naya Pakistan.

Shah’s post was re-tweeted by more than 1,300 users till the time of filing this story. Twitter user Pakistan my Pride’ put up a video with the same accusation as well. This post too was shared multiple times.

Soon, many news websites in Pakistan carried the same video which can be seen here.

In the video and pictures, Indian tennis star Sania Mirza is seen sitting beside her cricketer husband Shoaib Malik. Pacer Wahab Riaz is seen beside Malik.

However, AFWA found news articles clarifying that the video is two days old. According to these articles, the Pakistan Cricket Board has clarified that the players were in their hotel rooms the night before the match and had not violated any rule.
