With the completion of polling for the second phase of Lok Sabha elections, several celebrities and prominent figures were seen casting their votes and posing with inked index fingers. As polls were underway, a picture claiming that Google CEO Sundar Pichai came all the way from the United States to India to cast his vote went viral on social media. In the photo, Pichai can be seen with a few Indians.

The post has been shared by the Facebook page 'Poor Guy Sayings' and it has already been shared more than 1,200 times. The page has more than nine lakh followers on Facebook.

India Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be totally false. When we reverse-searched the photo, we found that the picture was taken when Pichai visited IIT Kharagpur in 2017. Pichai himself tweeted this photo at the time.

Also got to visit my alma mater (and old dorm room!) for the first time in 23 years. Thanks to everyone @IITKgp for the warm welcome! pic.twitter.com/OUn7mlKGI7 Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) January 7, 2017

Born in Tamil Nadu's Madurai, Pichai holds American citizenship, and therefore, he is not allowed to cast his vote in Indian elections.

As per the Election Commission of India (ECI), a person can vote in India if he/she is an Indian citizen. The EC also allows NRIs to cast their votes in India.
