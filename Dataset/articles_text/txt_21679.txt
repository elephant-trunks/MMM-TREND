Hostilities between Israel and Hamas have escalated, resulting in aerial bombings that have already killed dozens on both sides in the last few days. Amid this, a video of a huge fire and burning cars has gone viral with the claim that this is a recent explosion in Israel that has killed 650 Jews.

Several Facebook users have posted the video with the caption, "A big explosion happened in Israel where near about 650 jewish people killed"

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the viral claim to be misleading. Though Israel and Hamas are engaged in fierce clashes, no explosion of this scale has been reported from Israel. The video is from last year, when a massive explosion in an oil pipeline in Cairo, Egypt, gutted nearly 20 cars and injured many.

Using reverse image search, we found the original video from last year. Major news outlets across the world had published the video or stills from the video while reporting the incident that took place in July 2020.

As per these reports, the fire was triggered by a fracture in a pipeline carrying crude oil along the Cairo-Ismailia desert highway. The blaze incinerated at least 20 cars and injured 17 people. The same video was uploaded by "The Sun" on their YouTube channel on July 15, 2020.

So it can be concluded that though conflict has escalated between Israel and Hamas, this particular video is not related to the crisis. Also, we have not found any recent report confirming any explosion in Israel that has killed 650 Jews.
