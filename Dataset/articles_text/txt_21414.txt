Using InVID and reverse image search, we found that the video was uploaded by several media outlets based out of the United Kingdom in July 2020. “The Sun” had used the same video on July 9, 2020, in an article giving details about the incident.

“The Telegraph” had uploaded the same video on YouTube on July 10, 2020, with the title, “Asda employee faints in front of Prince Charles”.

As per these reports, Prince Charles was talking to an employee of supermarket chain Asda in Bristol, when the man started swaying and then collapsed in front of him. Immediate medical attention was given to the man. Prince Charles was visiting the supermarket to thank workers who helped run the centre amid the pandemic.

The global vaccine rollout for Covid-19 did not begin when the incident took place. As per a BBC report, the first vaccine was administered in the UK on December 8, 2020. This means the man in the viral video fainting in front of Prince Charles was not even vaccinated at the moment.

Reuters had also debunked the claim earlier.
