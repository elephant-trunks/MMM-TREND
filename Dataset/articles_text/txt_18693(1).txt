A photograph showing police personnel sit in protest holding posters with anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) signs, is fake and photoshopped.

It is the second morphed image shared to falsely claim that police have joined civilians in protest against the Act. The fake image comes at a time when police forces in several states are on edge trying to contain protests against the CAA and NRC (National Register of Citizens). So far 17 people have died in the protests, most of which have been out of clashes with police.

All three posters are fake and have been digitally altered from the original image.
