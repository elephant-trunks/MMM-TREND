An old video of a woman criticising the government at an anti-Citizenship Amendment Act rally in Delhi has resurfaced with a false claim misidentifying her as niece of late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The video has been shared on Facebook with a caption in English: This lady is Mannaya Atal Behari, niece (Brother’s daughter) of Atal Behari Vajpayee. Please listen to her, she is ripping off Modi and his gang.” The same video was viral in January, 2020 with a similar narrative.
