A biased mind or an agenda makes one fall for fakes or edited images/videos etc, or is it intentional ?

First the edited one has UP CM, Yogi Adityanath, Spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravishankar and Shefali Vaidya and another from the movie comparing both trying to give out a message that the fiction scene from movie came true now.

Truth –

The image tweeted by Jignesh Mevani and posted by Indian Atheists is photoshopped. A part from left of the image has been copied to right to make it wider. You can see two people copied on the right side.

Sri Sri Ravishankar and Yogi Adityanath represent the generational shift on Ayodhya issue

Spiritual leader and founder of Art of Living Sri Sri Ravi Shankar was on a three-day tour of UP recently. The three-day trip also called Anugrah Yatra saw the Guru and his disciples travel in Indian railways between Varanasi and Lucknow. The most crucial leg of this trip was a stopover on 27th Feb in Gorakhpur where Sri Sri Ravi and his devotees visited the Gorakhpur math. Gorakhpur math is one of the ancient shrines of Nath sampradaya. The Math is held in special reverence by Hindus all over the world. Also, the math is held in particular esteem by the local Muslims as well. What make the Photoshop more believable is the women in RED Saree but the woman in first photo i.e edited one was super imposed/pasted on the image and wasn’t part of the photo.

Shefali Vaidya also called this photoshop off claiming to be on few other Facebook pages which seems to have been deleted by now –

I feel really really sorry for Aaptards. They have now sunk to such low depths that they are now sharing my photoshopped pics on their FB pages!! pic.twitter.com/BNdVNm0K76 — Shefali Vaidya (@ShefVaidya) May 29, 2018

Happy that @RoflGandhi_ thinks I hobnob with people like @SriSri and @myogiadityanath, I just wish he’d photoshopped the picture better!! pic.twitter.com/7r947zEZtq — Shefali Vaidya (@ShefVaidya) May 29, 2018
