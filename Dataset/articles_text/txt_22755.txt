Patel uploaded this video on his Instagram page as well as his Facebook. In the post, Karan Patel said, "When you encroach their space they are bound to invade yours ...... #TODAY at #ARREY Road, this MAJESTIC #LION was #SEEN .... (at least the message I got said so) and even if it's not Arrey, it's a sight to be worried of."

THE TRUTH

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the video has nothing to do with Mumbai. The video is actually from Junagarh area of Gujarat where the Gir National Park is located. The video was aired by some news channels on July 13, 2019.



FACT CHECK

This video has been uploaded by many other social media users with the same claim that the lion is roaming in Mumbai. However, AFWA did a reverse search of the same and found that the video was uploaded by various news channels like this and this.

According to news reports, the lion was seen crossing the Bilkha road at Junagarh which is located on the outskirts of the Gir National Park. The logo of the park can be seen in this video as well.

CONCLUSION

The video of a lion crossing the road is being wrongly attributed to being from Mumbai. It is actually from Junagarh and was aired by various news channels only on July 13, Saturday.
