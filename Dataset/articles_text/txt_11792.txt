We found that neither of the photos were related to the recent Tara Air plane crash.

The first shows another aircraft by the airlines with the call sign 9N-ABM, while the second photograph shows the wreckage of the IAF helicopter that carried CDS General Bipin Rawat, which crashed in Coonoor, Tamil Nadu on 8 December 2021.
