A picture of a man wrapped in a Pakistani flag, wearing sunglasses and holding a gun while standing on the Tricolour, is going viral on social media with the claim that he is from Kolkata. In the picture, the man is seen pointing the gun at the Indian flag.

Several Facebook users have posted the image with a caption in Hindi that translates to, "This man is a resident of Santoshpuri in Kolkata's Maheshtala area. Make this so viral that he is arrested."

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the picture to be misleading. The two-year-old image is from Siwan in Bihar and the man, Sajid Hussain, was arrested for insulting the Tricolour after he had posted the picture on social media.

With the help of reverse image search, we found news reports related to the image.

A local news website called "Siwan Online" had reported on August 30, 2018, that a man who had posted his picture standing on the national flag was arrested from Siwan.

This incident was also reported by Hindi news website "Prabhat Khabar" on the same day.

As per these news reports, one Sajid Hussain, son of Tayyab Hussain, from Bihar's Siwan was arrested for insulting the Tricolour and posting the image on social media. "Prabhat Khabar" spoke to the local police and confirmed the news. This was also reported by the YouTube channel of "Punjab Kesari Bihar" on August 31, 2018.

Hence, it can be concluded that the viral image of a man disrespecting the national flag is nearly two years old and not from Kolkata. The incident took place in Bihar's Siwan in 2018 and the man was arrested.
