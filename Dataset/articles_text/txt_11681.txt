Soon after the BJP-led NDA announced former Governor of Jharkhand, Droupadi Murmu, as their presidential candidate, a twitter account by the handle of @dropati_murmu has cropped up on social media, claiming to be the official handle of the presidential candidate. Newschecker found this Twitter account to be an imposter.

The account has tweeted their pleasure for being nominated for the post of the President and has accepted congratulations from several BJP ministers regarding the same.

Fact Check /Verification

Newschecker found that the account had been created recently and used hashtags in the about section, which are both unlikely for official Twitter accounts.

Newschecker started by checking analysing the twitter page and found that the spelling of the name of the new Presidential candidate is spelt Droupadi and not Dropati. The same was noticed in a tweet by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Smt. Droupadi Murmu Ji has devoted her life to serving society and empowering the poor, downtrodden as well as the marginalised. She has rich administrative experience and had an outstanding gubernatorial tenure. I am confident she will be a great President of our nation. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) June 21, 2022

Upon further investigation, we checked the website of the election commission to check the affidavit submitted by the candidate.

According to the affidavit submitted, her name is spelt as ‘Smt. Droupadi Murmu’

The details mentioned in MyNeta website also confirmed that the spelling was Droupadi and not Dropati.
