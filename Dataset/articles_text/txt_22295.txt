A picture, purportedly showing United States President Donald Trump in his younger days, shaking hands with global terror mastermind Osama Bin Laden, is going viral on social media. Both are seen wearing suits and smiling.

The viral picture also has a quote superimposed on it, praising Laden, which is attributed to Trump. The quote says, “I knew Osama Bin Laden. People loved him. He was a great man that died for a worthy cause.”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the image is morphed. The original picture is of Trump meeting American publisher SI Newhouse Jr at NewYork City in 1987.

Several users have shared the viral image on Facebook. The archived version can be seen here.

The viral image looks suspicious from the word go as it was impossible for Al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden to meet Trump at a party, wearing a suit, leaving behind his camp in the mountains of Afghanistan.

Using reverse image search on the viral picture, we found the original image which was altered and manipulated digitally to create the fake one.

Morphed image

We found that the original image was posted by “Getty Images” in 1987 with a caption saying “Donald Trump At Trump Book Parky 1987”.

It was a picture of Trump and American publisher SI Newhouse who attended a book party at the Trump Tower in New York City in December 1987. This image was also used by “The Guardian”.

Original image

The quote superimposed on the viral image and attributed to Trump is also as fake as the image itself. Trump never called Laden a “great man” who died “for a worthy cause”.

Laden, the mastermind of the World Trade Centre attack on September 11, 2001, and numerous other attacks on American personnel and establishments across the world, was killed in a US military operation at his safehouse in Pakistan a decade later.
