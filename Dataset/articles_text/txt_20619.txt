Internet is all flooded with a clip of viral video of Mayawati, former CM of UP.

Where in an interview she is saying to vote for BJP (Bharatiya Janta Party) instead of voting to Radicals (kattarwadi Muslims). In that 35 sec video, Mayawati is also claiming that because of her the SC (Schedule Caste) and OBC (other backward classes) gave the vote to BJP.

Fact Check:-

Through our research of this viral video we get to know that, the viral video is from the year 2006 and not from the year 2022, hence not at all from the recent UP elections.

We also found old news covered by the Times of India (TOI) under the headline “Mayawati remarks trigger protests in UP.”

Moreover, the same news from November 10, 2006, was covered by a famous newspaper like Hindustan Times under the headline “I never called Muslims Fundamental.”

News channels like ABP News also covered this video their famous show “viral sach”
