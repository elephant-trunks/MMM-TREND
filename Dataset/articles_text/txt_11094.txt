Fact Check-

Google reverse image search led us to the same image shared by Akhilesh Yadav on Twitter in 2016. His tweet mentions that he is launching the Hausala Nutrition Scheme which would provide nutritious meals to pregnant women and malnourished children. He was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh at the time.

We searched about the Hausala Nutrition Scheme in 2016 and found a news report published by the Times of India. It mentioned that 700 Cr was arranged for this scheme to improve the health facilities among the needy by the Samajwadi government.

Conclusion-

Fact Crescendo found the claim made along with the video to be False. The viral image on social media is not related to Navratri. The image shows Akhilesh Yadav distributing food to children under a health scheme in 2016. Hence, the old image is shared with misleading claims.
