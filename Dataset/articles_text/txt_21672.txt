Amid heightened conflict between Israel and Hamas, and continuous rocket attacks and airstrikes against each other, a video has gone viral claiming to be the Israeli air defence system in action.

Several Facebook users have posted a video showing a dramatic exchange of fire between anti-aircraft guns and a fighter plane. The video shows anti-aircraft guns going full blast targetting the jet, while the latter manoeuvres through the hail of artillery. The Facebook caption reads, "Israel Defense System".

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that though Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system and its air force are in action against Hamas rocket attacks, but this particular video is not real. It is simulation graphics of ARMA 3 video game.
