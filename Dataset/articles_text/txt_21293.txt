A video of a young man peeing in public at an airport is circulating on social media with the claim that he is Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan. The 24-year-old was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau on October 3 last year in a drug-on-cruise case in Mumbai and granted bail more than three weeks later.

The video in circulation shows the youth, apparently disoriented, starting to pee in full public glare even as another man in red uniform tries to stop him. Onlookers can be heard gasping in disbelief.

One Twitter user shared this video with the caption, "ARYAN KHAN (S/O SHARUKH KHAN) FOUND 'HIGH' AT TORONTO AIRPORT".

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the man in the viral video is not Aryan Khan but Twilight-fame Canadian actor Bronson Pelletier. The video is from 2012 and Pelletier was then arrested for the act.

Reverse-searching key frames of the viral video, we found it was carried in a "Daily Mail" report dated February 23, 2013.

As per the report, the incident took place in December 2012 at the Los Angeles International Airport. Pelletier was reportedly found in a highly intoxicated state and was removed from a flight. He was given time to sober up in the terminal, and sometime later, was found urinating in public. He was later found guilty and sentenced to two years in probation.

Several other media outlets had also reported the incident.

We did not find any report of Aryan Khan peeing publicly at an airport. Clearly, an old and unrelated video is being circulated to target him.
