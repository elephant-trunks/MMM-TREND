A picture got multiplied on social media showing a tweet from the World Economic Forum (WEF), questioning whether the age of consent “should be lowered to 13 or less”.

People shared it rapidly believing its authenticity. The screenshot stated, “Should the age of consent be lowered to 13 or less? How the age of consent laws may be infringing on human rights @UNICEF https://wef.ch/tty56dX.”

A Facebook user captioned it as, “These WEF folks aren’t good people.

Another user captioned it as, “For those who thought the medical age of consent was and check out what ideas our powers that be think are progressive.”

@paulthacker11 also tweeted the same picture under the caption, “Call me crazy but I’m beginning to think these WEF folks aren’t good people.”
