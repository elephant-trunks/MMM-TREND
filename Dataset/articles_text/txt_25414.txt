ISLAMABAD (AP) – The 600 people of the Dawoodi bohra community were supposed to be gathering to have food together in a community hall soon after breaking a 15 1/2 -hour fast on Sunday.

Instead, those who gathered at the religious community center in Rawalpindi delayed the food in order to watch Pakistan’s historic win over India at the Champions Trophy on a giant TV screen. For them, and for millions of people across Pakistan, the taste of victory was sweet.

Also confirmed with Police station Mira Road, they haven’t heard of any such news.
