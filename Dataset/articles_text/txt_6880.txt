A disturbing video has been making the rounds on social media. It shows a truck crushing a man under its wheels. In the video, it appears as if the man ran toward the truck and jumped in its path.

Those sharing this video claimed this incident took place on the morning of July 20 in Deoband, Uttar Pradesh. They also claimed the man was Muslim and the truck was transporting Kanwariya pilgrims. Further, people claimed police had filed a case against the Kanwariya pilgrims, investigating if the man was killed intentionally.

AFWA’s investigation found the video is nearly five years old. Additionally, the police concluded that the man in the video died by suicide.

AFWA Probe

We reverse-searched grabs from the video and found the same video shared by a Facebook Page on July 18, 2017. This proved that the video was not recent.

Subsequent searches led us to multiple news reports on the incident. These reports that were published in July 2017 said that the man killed in this accident was identified as Wahid, a resident of the Lahaswada village of Deoband. The incident took place on the Saharanpur-Muzaffarnagar state highway.

Reportedly, a local captured the tragic incident on his phone. The video soon went viral. The reports also said that because it was clearly visible in the video that Wahid jumped in the truck’s path, his family agreed to perform the last rites and not press charges.

A Jagran report said that while the truck’s driver and its Kanwariya passengers were taken to a nearby police station, they were released later after questioning.

For more details, AFWA reached out to Prabhakar Shantaram, the SHO of the Deoband police station. “It became clear from the video that it was a suicide case. Therefore, we did not investigate this further. The family of the deceased also left with the body without making any complaints,” Shantaram said.
