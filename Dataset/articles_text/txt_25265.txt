SMHoaxSlayer ran a reverse image search after editing the crowd photo and found a reditt uploaded a similar photo in which although the head and sitting of Modi ji and Amit shah is same, the crowd is completely different. In the reditt image near the crowd some makeshift tents with Indian flag is visible. The image was from 27 December 2017, when Amit Shah and Narendra Modi was seen sharing a dais at the swearing-in ceremony of Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur.
