Recently in south-western Bangladesh, some unidentified people vandalised a Hindu community temple, shops and several houses over a Facebook post, allegedly, belittling Islam.

In the above context, an image is being widely shared on social media, showing Muslims standing with sticks and setting fire to some objects. The post claims that it is of the recent communal violence.

The post is shared with a caption: “নড়াইল জেলার লোহাগড়া উপজেলার দিঘলিয়া গ্রামে হিন্দুদের প্রায় দুই শতাধিক বাড়িঘরে শান্তির বাতাস বইতেছে। © ইসলাম শান্তির ধর্ম! ইসলাম মানবতার ধর্ম! ইসলাম হানাহানিতে বিশ্বাসী না।” (English translation: “Breeze of peace blowing in more than 200 houses of the Hindus in Dighalia village of Lohagarha sub-district, Narail district. Islam is a religion of peace! Islam is a religion of humanity! Islam does not believe in violence”)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did the fact-check, and found it to be misleading.

On doing a Google Reverse Image Search, we found the same image published by a Bangladeshi website, BD-Journal, on March 26, 2021. It says: “Madrasa students went on a rampage in Brahmanbaria following the clash between police and students at Hathazari Madrasa in custody-controlled Chittagong.”

The same image was also published by News 24-website on March 30, 2021. The report suggests that the image is of communal violence that took place in Brahmanbaria in Bangladesh.

Hence, we can ascertain that the viral image’s claim is misleading.
