A screenshot of a CNN’s tweet about the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet is going massively viral on the internet. The viral screenshot read, “The Dalai Lama sparks controversy, after stating white nationalist talking point on immigration and nationhood, causing condemnation. In a rambling conversation, the elderly monk appeared to suggest that the so-called, ” white countries” had a right to expel non-white people.”

Further, sharing the screenshot, @EuropeanRevolt wrote, “White nationalism is the only morally valid ideology in the west. And everyone knows it.”

Fact Check:

To verify the claim made in the viral screenshot, we first looked at all the tweets from CNN’s official Twitter account on May 9. But, we could not find any such tweet related to Dalai Lama.

when we searched on Google about this, we found in 2018 in Malmö city of Sweden a statement given by the Dalai Lama about refugees . In which he said that other countries were “morally responsible” for helping refugees facing danger , but that they should eventually return to rebuild their countries. “Europe belongs to the European people .”

Also in another statement he says that “in the short term , European countries should provide them shelter, and especially facilities for the education and training of children, including mechanical training for youth. The aim is that they finally be able to return to rebuild their countries. ”

Also in 2020, he said in an interview to Time that racial injustice It is the responsibility of the “people” to fight .
