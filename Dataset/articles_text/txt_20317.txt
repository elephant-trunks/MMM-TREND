Fact Check:

We did a Google search to investigate this news going viral. But we did not get any news of AAP MP Sanjay Singh thrashing any leader with shoes there. After this we searched on Google ‘ MP beat up politician with shoes .’ Further, we got a report of ‘ Hindustan ‘ newspaper published on 7th March 2019. Whose title- ‘ MP beats MLA with shoes , video went viral ‘ .

According to this report, this video is from Sant Kabirnagar district of UP. Where, during the district planning meeting, BJP MP Sharad Tripathi beat up his own party MLA Rakesh Singh Baghel with his shoes. This incident is 3 years old.

Then, we found the viral video on the YouTube channel of ‘ Aaj Tak ‘ . which was posted on 6th March 2019. This is the same video, which is being viral as being of Aam Aadmi Party.

Conclusion:

Hence, in our investigation of the viral video proves that the video of MP being thrashed with shoes is not of Aam Aadmi Party but of BJP. This incident is from 2019. But, social media users are sharing the video with a false and misleading claim.
