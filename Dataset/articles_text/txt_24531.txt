Ahead of the inauguration of Purvanchal Expressway, a flagship project by the Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government, top state officials spoke about the law-and-order situation in the state at a media briefing on November 17, 2021. Here, Awanish K Awasthi, Additional Chief Secretary (Home), and other top officials made claims about the state's crime rate and economic growth.



FactChecker looked at data recorded by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) and the Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation to verify their claims.

Claim 1: Uttar Pradesh is a crime-free state now, Awasthi was quoted as saying in a Hindustan Times report. "The crime rate has come down drastically in Uttar Pradesh. There is no danga (riots) in our state now as this government has a zero-tolerance policy against such elements," he added.

Fact: Misleading. Since it is unclear what sort of crime Awasthi was referring to, FactChecker referred to overall crime statistics of the state and found that in 2020, 3.55 lakh crimes punishable under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and 3.02 lakh crimes punishable under the Special and Local Laws (SLL) in were registered in the state, according to NCRB data. So, a total of 6.57 lakh crimes were committed in the state in 2020.

Moreover, 6,126 cases of riots were registered in UP in 2020 and the state recorded a 7.2% hike in riots cases since 2019. The only two states that saw more riots than UP in 2020, were Bihar (9,422) and Maharashtra (9,157).

In fact, during 2016-2020, an average of 7551 cases of riots were registered in UP every year. And, here too, UP ranks third, behind Bihar and Maharashtra, that have recorded an average of 10,055 and 8357 riots cases every year.

The NCRB classifies rioting cases in to 16 types: communal or religious-related rioting, sectarian, industrial, political, caste conflict, agrarian, students, money dispute, water dispute, land/property dispute, family disputes, enmity/rivalry, electric/power supply disputes, rioting while in andolan/morchas, rioting/attacks on police personnel or government servants and other rioting. Among these 15 categories, except 'other riots', these 5 topped the list in yearly average cases in the country:

11,241 riots over land or property dispute

4,489 riots over enmity rivalry

4,172 riots over family dispute

2,276 agrarian riots

1,943 riots during andolans or morchas (protests or rallies).

Between 2016 and 2020, the country saw an average of 55,299 cases of riots get registered every year and UP reported 13.6% of these.

FactChecker tried contacting Awasthi's office and other members of UP's home department, but the numbers were not reachable. This story will be updated as and when FactChecker gets a response from the official.

Claim #2: Uttar Pradesh is the second-largest economy in the country after Maharashtra, another top official claimed.
