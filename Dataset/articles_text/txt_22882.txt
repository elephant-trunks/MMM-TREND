BJP candidate from Bhopal, Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur has raked up another controversy by stating that she is proud of having participated in the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992. Eminent politicians and journalists on social media chided her and claimed that she was only 4 years old when she did it.

However, India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that this claim is not true. Sadhvi Pragya was already an adult in 1992.

The former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir Mehbooba Mufti tweeted a post of Krishna Pratap Singh which said that Sadhvi Pragya was born in 1988 and was only four years old when the Babri mosque was demolished in 1992.

The PDP chief took a jibe at Sadhvi and wrote on her tweet: India’s answer to boss baby that would put the adventures of Chota Bheem and Shin Chan to shame." Hundreds liked her tweet and many retweeted the post.

Lawyer Sanjay Hegde posted an article related to Sadhvi Pragya Singh claiming that she had climbed atop Babri Masjid in 1992. Hegde wrote on his tweet, "Kabhi toh sach bolo. Weren't you born in 1988? Didn't Babri get demolished in 1992? Or like V K Singh, do you have two dates of birth?".

Hegde’s post has been retweeted 177 times and liked by 391 twitter users till the filling of this story. Lawyer Sanjay Hegde has 86.7 k followers on Twitter.

On Facebook, too, such claims have appeared with a user like Madhumita Chakraborty reiterating the same thing, that Pragya Singh Thakur was born on 1988, so she was only 4 years old in 1992, during Babri Masjid demolition incident.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) looked for public documents which would establish Sadhvi’s exact age. Sadhvi Pragya has been an accused in the 2008 Malegaon bomb blast case. In 2016 she filed a petition for bail in the Bombay high court and in that she had claimed that her age was 44. This is reflected in the judgement of 2017 which can be seen here and here.

So, according to this, if Sadhvi Pragya was 44 in 2016, then she would have been born in 1972 and would have been 20 years old when Babri Masjid incident took place.

To probe further AFWA spoke to Sadhvi Pragya's elder sister Upma Singh who is right now busy campaigning along with her sister in Bhopal. Singh said, "Sadhvi's birth date is 02.02.1970 and it is mentioned in her mark sheets and Aadhar card as well."

Since both of them are busy in the election campaign, so she could not provide us with the Aadhar document, immediately. AFWA will update the story whenever we get the document.

In the meantime, going by the judgment papers of Bombay High court it can be clearly said that Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur was not a minor during Babri Masjid incident in 1992 as she was not born in 1988.
