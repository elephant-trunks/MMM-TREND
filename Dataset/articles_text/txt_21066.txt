Following incidents of communal violence during Ram Navami processions across states, a photo of protesters holding an anti-Narendra Modi banner has been making the rounds. It claimed to show Malaysian Muslims expressing solidarity with Indian Muslims following the violence.

On Twitter, one person shared the photo with the text, “Malaysian Muslims protest against attacks on #IndianMuslims.” Hashtags like #IndianMuslimsUnderAttack #IndianMuslimsGenocideAlert accompanied the photo.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the viral image was from a 2020 anti-CAA protest in Malaysia. The Hizb-ut-Tahrir, an international fundamentalist group, protested in front of the High Commission of India in Kuala Lumpur.

With the help of a reverse image search, we found that the viral image has been on several Malaysian news portals since 2020.

The Malaysian news portal, “The Khilafah”, published the photograph in a report on March 6, 2020, titled, “Hizb-ut-Tahrir Malaysia: Hizb-ut-Tahrir Demands Modi to Stop Persecution against Muslims in India”.

Per the report, the Hizb-ut-Tahrir Malaysia (HTM), an Islamist organisation in Malaysia, demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in India in 2020.

The protest occurred at the High Commission of India in Kuala Lumpur to hand over a memorandum of protest to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, condemning discrimination against Muslims in the backdrop of the CAA.

The Hizb-ut-Tahrir also reported on this protest on its website, where it confirmed handing over a memorandum of protest to the Indian High Commission in March 2020. You can read the group’s press release on the matter here.

Following incidents of communal violence during Ram Navami, hashtags like #IndianMuslimsUnderAttack have trended and continued to trend. But while verifying the facts of this story, we did not find any news reports on Malaysian Muslim groups expressing solidarity with Indian Muslims through protests.

Thus, we concluded that this 2020 photo of an anti-CAA protest in Kuala Lumpur was not related to recent incidents of communal violence in India.
