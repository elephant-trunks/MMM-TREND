A screengrab of a TV news report claiming the Union government announced a bonus for wheat farmers has been making the rounds on social media.

Many shared the grab from ABP News that said, "Modi government takes a big decision regarding wheat farmers." It also said, "Wheat farmers will receive a bonus of Rs. 525 per quintal," and, "Low wheat production led to the decision."

The TV news report's screengrab also contained a photo of Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmer Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the claim in this post was misleading. The Union government did not announce a bonus for the wheat farmers. The screengrab was digitally altered.

AFWA PROBE

While investigating the claim, we first looked for news reports on bonuses announced by the government for wheat farmers. However, we did not find anything relevant.

A Business Standard report dated September 8, 2021, stated that the government increased the minimum support price (MSP) for wheat by 2.03 per cent for the financial year 2022-23.

From Rs. 1,975 per quintal in 2021-22, the MSP rose to Rs. 2,015 per quintal for the financial year 2022-23.

The Press Information Bureau had a press release regarding this announcement on the same date.

SOURCE OF THE VIRAL IMAGE

We conducted a reverse search of the image and found a YouTube channel called "Anaj Mandi Expert" had used it as the thumbnail for a video it shared on March 16, 2022.

The video made the same claim mentioned in the thumbnail but did not cite any sources. It also did not inform how farmers could avail this bonus. The comments section of the video was full of people refuting this claim.

We also did not find any such report on the website or the YouTube channel of ABP News.

Thus, we concluded that the photo making the rounds on social media contains a misleading claim.
