A 15-second clip supposedly showing about a dozen baby giraffes running around playfully in a park has caught the attention of social media users. Several Facebook users have shared the video, believing it to be real.

RPG Group chairman Harsh Goenka also tweeted the video with the caption, "I didn't know baby giraffes look like this- exact miniature copy! .... so cute !"

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is not real, but a creation by digital artist Vernon James Manlapaz.

An artist's creation

Using InVID and reverse image search, we found the video was shared on Instagram by Manlapaz in August 2020.

The artist did not mention that it was a CGI creation. But his Instagram account is full of what he calls "short magical videos". His creations include oversized beatles, flying turtles, and jumping paper rolls.

Here's another of his creation.

Philippines-born and Los Angeles-based animator Manlapaz has already created quite a sensation with his magical creations. Several websites have published features on his creations.

The artist explains his inspiration in an interview with the website "Vice". "My creative process usually starts by looking at my surroundings and asking myself, 'What if?' From there I get inspiration from games, movies, people, and life in general," says Manlapaz.

Fact-check website "Snopes" had earlier debunked the claim when several others had claimed that the viral video of the baby giraffes was real.
