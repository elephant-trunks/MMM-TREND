A video of a woman singing devotional 'Krishna songs' is getting viral on social media. It is being claimed that the singer is Musthafa Parvez, the daughter of veteran singer Mohammed Rafi.

India Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the vocalist in the viral video is Gitanjali Rai and she has no connections with Mohammad Rafi.

The video, which has gone viral on Facebook and Twitter, was posted with the caption: "Mohd Rafi's daughter Musthafa Parvez who is Lord Krishna's devotee has a Splendid voice. Please watch this video."

To find the truth, we took one of the key-frames from the video and ran a reverse search. We found the longer version of the video posted by a YouTube channel 'Gitanjali Rai' on April 14, 2013. The video was titled 'Hari sundar nand mukunda - Gitanjali Rai'. One can listen to the viral part from 1 minute 11 seconds into the video.

We did a Google search to find out who Gitanjali Rai is and came across her official website. The site defines her as a teacher, a ghazal singer, a devotional singer, a motivational speaker and a life coach. One can also find videos of her singing on the site.

Gitanjali's birthplace is Amritsar but she is based in Pune. Click here to view her Twitter handle and Facebook page.

We contacted Gitanjali's office which denied the viral claim. We also found a YouTube video posted on August 11 where she clarified that she is not Musthafa Parvez or the granddaughter of Mohammed Rafi.

The youngest son of singer Mohammed Rafi, Shahid Rafi told Boomlive that "the singer has nothing to do with Rafi family."

Shahid said, "We are seven siblings- four sons and three daughters and none of Rafi's daughters is named Parvez Musthafa."

Therefore, it is clear that the devotional singer in the viral video is Gitanjali Rai and not Musthafa Parvez. And also that she is not the daughter of Mohammad Rafi.
