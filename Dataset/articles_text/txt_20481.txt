Fact check

After cross-checking we found that the video is from 2016. The article of Daily Mail.com, says that the sky in North California was filled with paratroopers as a part of the exercise. Thus the video was of North California and not Ukraine. Furthermore, on the edited video, the heading was ‘American soldier landing to Ukraine’ while in the original video no such headlines are made.

Another proof

AiirSource Military also posted the video of hundreds of paratroopers landing in Fort Bragg, North California on 28th May 2016.

Conclusion: Hence proving that video is a claim is misleading.
