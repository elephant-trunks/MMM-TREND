Amidst the invasion of Ukraine, a big claim has been made quoting Russian President Vladimir Putin. In which it is said that Putin has nationalized Russia’s central bank to end the control of the Rothschilds.

A Facebook post said that “Vladimir Putin, he ended Rothschild’s (sic) control over Russia by nationalizing the Russian centralized bank.” “They banned GMO’S and created a currency to compete against the dollar.”

Fact Check

Upon investigation of the above claim, we learned that the Russian bank had been nationalized long before Putin’s first term. Indeed, Russia’s central bank was established by the former Russian Emperor Alexander II in 1860, originally named “State Bank”. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1992, it was renamed “Bank of Russia”.

At the same time, financial advisory Rothschild & Company has an office in Moscow for nearly a decade. The Rothschilds, however, had nothing to do with the origin of the bank. Also former Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich first announced the Russian government’s plan to ban GMO at an international biotechnology conference in 2015. Which Putin approved in 2016. Also, there is no evidence that Putin has created a new currency in Russia.

Conclusion

Therefore, Putin’s claim of nationalizing the central bank and creating a new Russian currency to end Rothschilds’ control is false.
