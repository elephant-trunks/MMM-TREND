A picture in which some policemen are seen cleaning the mosque is viral with the claim that the police in West Bengal clean the mosque.

A twitter account, Satviksoul, which describes itself as a blind Modi bhakth, has posted the same image on 27th November, 2021 with the description “Policemen are cleaning a mosque in West Bengal!!! Has any policeman cleaned a temples? What a fall!!!” The tweet has reached 180 retweets and 403 likes.

This claim went viral in 2017 as well. Several Facebook accounts have posted this picture with the same claim.

Fact Check:

On performing a simple reverse image search of the viral photo, it was found that the image is from Bhainsa, Telangana, and it is of June 2016, when Telangana Police officials cleaned temples and mosques as a part of the Swachh Bharat Programme.

Hence, the image is viral with the fake and misleading. West Bengal Police is not being forced to clean Mosques. Instead it is the image of 2016 of Telangana Police cleaning the mosques and temples under the Swachh Bharat Programme.
