A picture of a girl in hijab seated behind a desk and surrounded by men in uniform, with a Maharashtra Police board behind, is circulating on social media with the claim that the first Muslim woman IPS officer from Urdu medium joined office in a burqa, thus violating the force’s dress code.

Multiple Facebook users with a caption in Hindi that translates to, “First IPS from Urdu medium becomes an SP in Maharashtra. On her first day, she adopted the Islamic dress code instead of police dress code. Congratulations to the Shiv Sena government. Its contribution to Ghazwa-e-Hind will be admirable.”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false. The girl in the image is 14-year-old Sahrish Kanwal, who was symbolically made the DSP for a day in Maharashtra’s Buldhana, ahead of International Women’s Day this year.

The claim is quite viral on Facebook . The archived versions can be seen here, here and here.



With the help of reverse image search, we found that the event was reported by The Times of India on March 5. As per this report, ahead of International Women’s Day on March 8, a 14-year-old girl was made the superintendent of police (SP) for a day in Buldhana district of Maharashtra.

Sahrish Kanwal, from the Zilla Parishad Urdu High School in Malkapur tehsil, took over as SP after the Buldhana district administration gave an opportunity to bright girls of government schools to act as top administrative officials for a day.

The YouTube Channel of “The Times of India” published the video of the event on March 5, 2020. The viral image of the girl sitting surrounded by police personnel can be seen here.

India Today had earlier debunked another misleading claim related to the same viral image that can be read here.

Hence, it is confirmed that the viral claim of a woman IPS officer joining work in a burqa is false.
