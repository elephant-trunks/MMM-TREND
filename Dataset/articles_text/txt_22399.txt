Images of hospital beds and patients being treated in the open are going viral on social media with the claim that hospitals in Italy have run out of space due to the spread of coronavirus and people should therefore stay indoors and listen to the government.

Facebook page "Fiji Saas Pato - supports local talent" uploaded a set of four pictures and said, "Learn from Italy, no more spaces are left in the hospitals. Stay home and follow what the Government says. #stay safe #stay home #Coronavirus". The archived version can be seen here.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the photographs are not from Italy but Croatia after it was rocked by an earthquake on March 22. However, the message that the post intends to convey is true as social isolation is being harped on by every coronavirus-infected country.

These very photographs have been shared in Hindi as well as Marathi with the same claim.

A reverse search of the viral images shows that the pictures are from Zagreb, the capital of Croatia. This European country was rocked by an earthquake of 5.3 magnitude on Sunday. Several buildings were damaged, including the Parliament of Croatia. One person had died in the incident and several injured.

Like many other countries, Croatia too was not untouched by the Covid-19 pandemic - it reported more than 200 cases. Authorities there are battling the twin disasters and reports about it can be read here.
