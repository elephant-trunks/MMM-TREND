A photo of a receipt is being shared on social media with a claim that now GST is also being imposed for using toilets. The receipt is reportedly from Punjab where one extra rupee is collected as GST on a toilet usage charge of five rupees. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.

Claim: Now there is also GST for using toilets. The photo shows a receipt as an example from Punjab. Fact: No, there is no GST on using toilets. The GST is NIL on “Services by way of public convenience such as provision of facilities of bathroom, washrooms, lavatories, urinal or toilets.” Also, the posted receipt photo is an old one that was already called ‘fake’ back in 2017 by related authorities. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.

When we checked on the CBIC-GST website for information related to the claim made in the post, it was found that there is no GST on using toilets. It can be read that the GST is NIL on “Services by way of public convenience such as provision of facilities of bathroom, washrooms, lavatories, urinal or toilets.”

The posted receipt photo is an old one. The same photo is viral on the internet since July 2017 as a receipt of the Sulabh toilet at Ludhiana Bus stand. As the photo went viral, ‘The Indian Express’ reported in 2017 that – “AK Singh, Controller of Sulabh International Social Service Organisation in Punjab, said that they don’t even have a centre at the said bus stand in Ludhiana. Gursewak Rajpal, Ludhiana bus stand manager, also agreed with Singh and said it’s fake.” Also, the extra rupee GST collected on the five rupees toilet usage charge in the posted receipt translates to 20% GST, which is not one of the GST tax slabs.

To sum it up, there is no GST for using toilets. The posted receipt was called ‘fake’ by related authorities in 2017 itself.
