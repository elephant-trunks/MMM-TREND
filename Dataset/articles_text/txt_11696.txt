A video that shows Prime Minister Narendra Modi not acknowledging former President Ram Nath Kovind while others greet him during his farewell ceremony is going viral on social media with a claim that Modi deliberately "ignored" Kovind and posed for a photograph.

The claim was widely shared by Opposition leaders from Telangana Rashtra Samithi, Aam Aadmi Party, and Congress.
