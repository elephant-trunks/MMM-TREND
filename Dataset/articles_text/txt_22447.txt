Is the Arvind Kejriwal government providing monetary help only to Muslim victims of the Delhi riots? This is what is being claimed with a viral photo of a Hindi newspaper advertising the Delhi government’s assistance scheme for riot victims.

The viral image shows the word Muslim’ in the top right corner beside the header Danga peedito ki madad hetu (For the aid of riot victims). It gives the impression that the government is providing monetary help only to Muslim victims. The claim along with the photo also says that the Delhi government is biased in providing compensation to riot victims.
