FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did a fact-check and found the claim to be fake.

We clicked on the link mentioned in the post and found that it took users to the Google Playstore. The link mentioned that the app was developed by Aim2Excel.

We however could not find any link between Aim2Excel and the Government of India. Also, a user mentioned that after submitting the registration fees, there was no response App.

We also found that PIB Fact Check had earlier tweeted and said that the Government of India does not have any scheme named Pradhan Mantri Loan Yojana. The Tweet read, “केंद्र सरकार की “प्रधानमंत्री लोन योजना’ के तहत सभी आवेदन कर्ताओं को 2,00,000रु की राशि दे रही है | #PIBFactcheck: यह दावा झूठा है | केंद्र सरकार की “प्रधानमंत्री लोन योजना” नामक कोई योजना नहीं है |”

(English translation, “Under the “Pradhan Mantri Loan Yojana” of the Central Government, an amount of Rs 2,00,000 is being given to all the applicants. #PIBFactcheck: This claim is false. There is no scheme called “Pradhan Mantri Loan Yojana” by the Central Government.”)

Hence, we can ascertain that the viral claim is fake.
