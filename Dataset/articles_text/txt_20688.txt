These days we can find a lot of misinformation regarding historical facts. Today, DFRAC has come up with one such news. PIB has posted the latest issue of the New India Samachar report. Along with the PIB wrote that there has been great participation of the common man in the freedom movement. But, people have forgotten many of them. With the purpose to shift the spotlight on these anonymous freedom fighters, #AmritMahotsav celebrations have been started.

Everything was good here until misinformation caught the eyes of trollers. The New India Samachar’s latest issue said the Bhakti movement heralded the freedom struggle in India. Further, it said Swami Vivekananda, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and Ramanna Marishi served as precursor to the revolt.

Consequently, many social media users replied with many mocking comments.

Swami Vivekananda and Ramana Maharshi time-travelled to before 1857 to create a spiritual consciousness which acted as precursor for rebellion? Bravo 👏👏👏 — A Maliyam Ibrahim (@IbrahimMaliyam) January 11, 2022

FactCheck

As a matter of fact, Swami Vivekananda was born in 1863 (6 years after 1857). Also, Ramana Maharishi was born in 1879 (22 years after 1857). Hence, they can not be precursors to the ‘revolt of 1857’. Moreover, The Bhakti movement was a religious movement in medieval Hinduism that sought to bring religious reforms to all strata of society. It adopted the method of devotion to achieve salvation. Hence, the information in The New India Samachar report was fake and misleading.

Conclusion

After getting roasted on the social media platforms PIB made some changes in their The New India Samachar report. At last, they removed the names of Swami Vivekanand, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Rmana Maharishi.
