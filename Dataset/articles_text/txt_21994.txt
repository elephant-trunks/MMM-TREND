A magnificent picture of a tree carved in the shape of a hand is being circulating on social media. It is being said that this tree is located at Dogripora village in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir.

The picture has been shared with the caption, "Tree Carving. North Kashmir dogripora.."

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The viral picture is of "The Giant Hand of Vyrnwy" in Wales, United Kingdom.

The archived version of the post can be seen here. The claim is being shared by several Facebook users.

Reverse-searching the viral picture, we found it was a tree once regarded as UK's tallest but which had to be felled due to safety reasons. Located at the Lake Vyrnwy estate in Wales, it was later transformed into a beautiful sculpture of a hand by artist Simon O'Rourke.

We found the viral image in a website where it has been shared with the title, "The Giant Hand of Vyrnwy. Sculptured by Simon O'Rourke. Standing 50ft or nearly 15.5 meters."

With the help of keyword search, we found an article by BBC News about how the tree was converted into a beautiful sculpture. According to the article, this tree was once taller than a 20-storey building with a height of around 209 feet.

Simon O'Rourke, the artist who created the sculpture, has shared his experience on his website too. There are several pictures of "The Giant Hand of Vyrnwy" in the "Alamy" stock photo website as well.

We did not find any report about any such tree carved in the shape of a hand in Kashmir's Dogripora. Thus, it is clear that the viral picture of a tree carved in the shape of a human hand is not from J&K but Lake Vyrnwy in Wales, UK.
