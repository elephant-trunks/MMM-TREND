The claim of donating land to the Indian Army has recently caught fire on social media.

The news which says Actor Suman has donated 117 acres of land to the Indian Army has created a heroic impact on viewers. People are praising him for his thoughtful deeds.

Fact Check

An article of News 18 says that the Actor has declared the news is false as soon as he got to know about it and further adds that the case regarding the 117 acres of land is still going on in court. After he gets the land out of controversy, he will inform it on social media. He carried different plans for the land, like opening an Ayurveda Resort, Open Studio and later he also thought of donating the land for the welfare of the Army. Hence proving the claim is misleading.
