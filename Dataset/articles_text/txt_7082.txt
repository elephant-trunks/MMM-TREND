A video is being shared on social media claiming it as recent visuals of the dead livestock that drowned during the floods in India. Sharing the video, this post claims that 711 sheep have lost their lives because of the rainfall in India. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.

Claim: Recent video showing a flock of sheep lying dead in rainwaters in India. Fact: The video shows the dead livestock that drowned during the floods caused by the torrential rainfalls in Saudi Arabia’s Arar city in 2020. The video shared in the post is old and has nothing to do with India. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.

On reverse image search of the screenshots of the video, a video with similar visuals was found in a tweet made by the ‘Arabia Weather-Saudi Arabia’ Twitter handle on 12 November 2020. Sharing the video, ‘Arabia Weather-Saudi Arabia’ tweeted that more than a thousand sheep have lost their lives because of the torrential rainfall in Arar city in Saudi Arabia. A few other Youtube channels have also published this video with a similar description in November 2020.

When we searched for further sources using these keywords, we found the details of this video in an article published by the ‘Q8 News’ website on 14 November 2020. Publishing similar photos of the dead livestock, this article reported that the floods that swept Arar city in Saudi Arabia caused the death of hundreds of sheep owned by a Saudi citizen. Reporting the same, several news websites published articles in November 2020. A few of them can be read here, here and here.

Lately, a flock of twenty sheep died due to lightning during heavy rainfall in Shivpuri city of Madhya Pradesh. But, it has nothing to do with the video shared in the post.

To sum it up, an old video from Saudi Arabia is shared as recent visuals of the dead livestock submerged during floods in India.
