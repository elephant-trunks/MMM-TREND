A picture of the famous Italian city of Venice is going viral on social media sites. It can be seen in this picture that the settlement of the city of Venice is in the shape of a heart.

A user named Jules tweeted a picture of a drone shot with the caption, “Venice, Italy”. The heart-warming smile of Venice can be seen in this picture.

Fact Check:

On reverse image search of the image on the internet, we found that the same image was shared on a Facebook page called Home Decor Ideas with the caption, “Mirrored Aerial View of Venice, Italy Photo & Edit by: @lennart [IG]“. It is clear from the caption itself that this picture has been edited.

At the same time, we found the original picture on Instagram’s page lennart, whose caption read, “BREAKING NEWS! Scientists have just discovered that the city of true love is not Paris, but Venice! Swipe to see the scientific proof! Don’t believe everything you read online. Believe in love, Happy Valentine.” (Hindi translation)

It can be seen in this picture that Venice is not settled in the shape of a heart. The same reality can be seen on Google Maps as well.

Conclusion:

It is clear from this fact check by DFRAC that the picture of the city that is going viral is edited/photoshopped, as in reality, Venice is not in the shape of a heart. Hence, users are sharing it with a false claim.
