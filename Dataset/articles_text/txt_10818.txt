Fact Check-

We started our investigation by running a reverse image search on Google, whose results led us to a tweet with the same claim that posted a clearer version of the image. In the clearer imager, we saw that the man capturing the selfie is wearing a TTE badge with “Bangladesh Railway” written on it.

This suggests that the image could be from Bangladesh and not India.

We ran a keyword search on Google and found few Bengali news reports published in 2019 by kalerkontho and rtvonline which that the the image indeed shows a father and son duo working for the Bangladesh railways. The father works as a Railways guard while the son named Wasibur Rahman works as a TTE. The image captured when both their trains crossed each other at the Phulbury Railways Station. We found that this image was posted on Facebook by Washibur Rahman Shuvo in May 2019.

Conclusion-

Fact Crescendo found the claim made along with the viral image to be out of context. The viral image shows a father son duo but they do not work for the Indian railways. Instead, they work for Bangladesh Railways.
