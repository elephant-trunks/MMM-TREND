A video of vandalism at a programme venue has gone viral with the claim that this is the repercussion of the scrapping of the laws.

The Hindi caption on the Facebook video reads: “See brother, after the announcement of the withdrawal of all three agricultural laws, the trends have started coming...None of the “Godi” media will show it”.

Meanwhile, India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading.
