Twenty-eight assembly constituencies in Madhya Pradesh are going for by-elections on November 3. Amid hectic campaigning, a video of a protest rally against chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan with an effigy of a body has gone viral on social media.

Several Facebook users have posted the video, Hindi text superimposed on which reads, "Mama nahi kasai hai, Kans ka jurwa bhai hai". The video is part of a news capsule with a commentary running in the background. It has logos of "MP Tak" and "Mobile Tak" and the location says "Satna".

The Hindi commentary and the sound bite of a protester says accredited social health activists (ASHA) were protesting against low wages given by the Shivraj Singh government. The video shows women carrying an effigy of a body covered in a white shroud.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video of the protest rally is two years old. In 2018, ASHA workers in MP's Satna demonstrated against the state government on issues related to their wages.

The archived versions of the posts can be seen here, here and here.

The protest

Getting cues from the sound bites and slogans in the video, and with the help of keywords, we found the original video uploaded by YouTube channel "chaupal" on October 18, 2018. This video does not have any text superimposed on it. The movie title says, "Madhya Pradesh: Shivraj Singh ki Arthi Nikalti Janta". This video is longer than the viral clip.

According to this report, ASHA workers protested against the Shivraj Singh government at Satna in October 2018.

We found several news reports published at that time, which say ASHA workers were protesting in several parts of MP demanding fixed salary and travel allowances.

Hence, it is confirmed that a two-year-old video of a protest against the Shivraj Singh government has been revived on social media in the backdrop of upcoming bypolls in Madhya Pradesh.
