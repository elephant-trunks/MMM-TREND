After the landmark accord between the UAE and Israel, an image of Burj Khalifa in Dubai has gone viral with the claim that the world's tallest building lit up in the colours of the Israeli flag. The viral image shows that the skyscraper lit in white light and a star in the middle, representing the Israel flag.

Several users on Twitter and Facebook have posted this viral image of Burj Khalifa believing that it lit up with the Israeli flag after the historic pact between the two countries.

India Today Anti-Fake News War room (AFWA) found the claim to the viral image as misleading. Burj Khalifa was not lit up in the colours of the Israeli flag on August 13, 2020.

The archived versions of the posts are saved here, here and here.

Multiple Facebook users have posted the viral image.

As per the official social media platforms of the Burj Khalifa, like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, the building was never lit up with Israel flag colours till August 16, 2020.

On August 15, Burj Khalifa was lit up in the colours of Tricolour - the Indian National flag - commemorating India's 74th Independence Day.

With the help of a reverse image search, we found the original image which was morphed with the Israel flag. The original photograph was found in a food blog website named "Julia's Album".

We could not find any credible website that shows that the world's tallest building is lit in the Israel flag. Hence, it can be concluded that the viral image is photoshopped.
