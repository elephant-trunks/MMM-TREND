A video showing a massive landslide is being shared on social media with a claim that it shows the landslide that took place at Anmod Ghat in Goa (Karnataka-Goa border).

The text reads: “Landslide at Anmod Ghat, Goa”

Here’s the link to the above post.

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did the fact-check, and found it to be misleading.

On doing a Google Reverse Image Search with one of the screenshots, we found the same video was uploaded by a YouTube channel on June 23, 2022, with a caption: “Footage of a landslide at Silchar — Mizoram Highway (NH 306)”

Another YouTube channel, Current Affairs, also uploaded the video on June 23, 2022, claiming that it is a landslide at Silchar — Mizoram Highway (NH-306).

A report by local media outlet Tak News also claims that the video is of the Assam landslide. However, NewsMobile independently couldn’t confirm the claim.

Earlier, NewsMobile debunked the same post when it was shared as that from Maharashtra’s Rajapur.

Hence, it is clear that the viral video is NOT from Goa.
