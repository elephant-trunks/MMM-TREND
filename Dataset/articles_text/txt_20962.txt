The media cell of the Samajwadi Party (SP), the principal opposition party in Uttar Pradesh on Friday, May 27, tweeted a photo of a police station in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh. A banner outside the police station announced that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers were not allowed inside.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the claim was misleading.
