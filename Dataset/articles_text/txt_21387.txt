A video of some men in traditional Punjabi attire playing dhol inside an aircraft, much to the amusement of passengers, is circulating on social media with the claim that this was Tata Air India’s first flight from India to Canada.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is from 2018. It shows the celebrations before the first flight took off from Birmingham, United Kingdom, to Amritsar after a gap of eight years.
