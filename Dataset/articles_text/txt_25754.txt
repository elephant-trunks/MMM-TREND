India’s northeastern region and several parts of Bangladesh including Sylhet are seeing the worst flooding in nearly 20 years, which has affected millions of people.

In this backdrop, a video showing a temple standing in gushing waters is being widely shared on social media linking it to flooding in Sylhet.

The video is being shared on Facebook with a caption in Bengali: “হাজার হাজার ঘর-বাড়ি বাংলাদেশের সিলেট-সুনামগঞ্জে নদীর জলে তলিয়ে যাচ্ছে, কিন্তু ঈশ্বরের ঘর(মন্দির) এখনো মাথা উচু করে দাড়িয়ে আছে.. হর হর মহাদেব”

(English translation: Thousands of houses are being submerged in the river in Sylhet-Sunamganj of Bangladesh, But the house of God (temple) is still standing with its head held high)

Here’s the link to the above post.

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim and found it to be MISLEADING.

A simple Reverse Image Search directed us to a YouTube video uploaded on September 15, 2021, which carried the same viral video stating that it was the Shri Kapileshwar Temple in Sarangpur, Madhya Pradesh.

The same visuals were also carried in another YouTube video dated August 22, 2020, with the description, “Sarangpur#MP: Reporter- Shafiq Ansari on river drain overflowing due to heavy rains.”

We searched further and found a Vlog on Shri Kapileshwar Temple that carried visuals of the same temple. The temple seen in that vlog is exactly the same as the temple seen in the viral video.

We further searched on Google Maps and found that this temple is located in the middle of the Kali Sindh river in Madhya Pradesh.

Thus, it is evident from the above information that an old video from Madhya Pradesh is being falsely linked to recent floods in Bangladesh.
