As Cyclone Shaheen battered Oman and Iran, killing at least 13 people and submerging streets and houses, a video of a dramatic plane landing amid turbulent winds is circulating on social media as visuals from Oman.

The video shows a plane landing sideways on a runway in the middle of a storm, and users shared the clipping with captions like “Pray for Oman” or hashtags such as #CycloneShaheen.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the daring sideways landing took place at Bristol airport in the United Kingdom during Storm Callum in 2018.

The archived version of the tweet is saved here.

On the video, one can see “The Sun” logo on the top right-hand corner. Taking this as a clue, and with the help of keyword search, we found the video published on the website of British tabloid “The Sun” on October 15, 2018.

As per the article, it was a TUI Airways plane that landed at Bristol airport in 2018 after getting caught in Storm Callum that had a wind speed of 77 miles per hour.

The incident was also reported by other international media outlets in 2018.

According to these reports, Captain Brenda Riepsaame Wassink, the pilot of TUI Boeing 757-200, had to make this tricky manoeuvre to ensure safe landing amid the storm.

On the other hand, Oman rescheduled several flights to and from Muscat airport in view of Cyclone Shaheen. Other Gulf countries are on high alert as rescue and relief efforts continue in full force in Oman. However, it is certain that the viral video is from UK and not Oman.
