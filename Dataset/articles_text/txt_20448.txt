After doing the reverse image search, we got to know that these four photos have been taken from the different incidents that happened with the Pakistani Aircraft.

According to Daily Pakistan, an aircraft from the viral picture got crashed at Mainwali Airbase and killed two PAF officers in January 2017.

The accident took place because of bad weather conditions.

Another picture was of a PAF jet crashing near Sargodha during a training mission.

Therefore, recently no such attacks were made by India and Iran over the Pakistani jet and old pictures of the crash were circulated on internet.
