The Nupur Sharma row continues to unfold. From death threats to several FIRs to public interest litigation in the Supreme Court, Sharma’s controversial remarks on the Prophet Muhammad have caused a storm.

Amid all this, a video has gone viral with the claim that, despite all the drama, the now-suspended Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson appears fairly nonchalant — defiant even — in the face of all the opposition. The video shows Sharma and a group of people shouting, “How’s the Josh?” followed by, “High, sir!” They also chant, “Jai Hind!” a couple of times.

Those sharing the video wrote captions like, “This is what you call, rub salt into wounds. We are proud of the lioness, Nupur Sharma,” and, “Queen After Offending 1 Billion.”

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the claim was false. The video is from 2019 and has no connection with the ongoing row.

While investigating the claim, we first reverse-searched frames from the video and found the original video on Sharma’s verified Twitter account. She shared it on January 26, 2019.

The caption of the video read: “Celebrating Republic Day and URI - The Surgical Strike with old college friends!” Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bollywood actor Vicky Kaushal were also tagged in the tweet.

The film “Uri: The Surgical Strike” directed by Aditya Dhar, was released in January 2019. Aside from Kaushal, the film's star cast included Paresh Rawal, Mohit Raina, and Yami Gautam. The plot revolves around the death of 19 soldiers during a terrorist attack at the army headquarters in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir, and the Indian Army’s subsequent retaliation.

Hence, we concluded that this video has no connection with the ongoing Nupur Sharma row following her comments on the Prophet Muhammad. The video is from January 26, 2019.
