A video is going viral on social media. It can be seen in this video that a girl is telling that she lives in a Muslim locality, so she is being harassed for being a Hindu. The girl further tells that under pressure from the local leader, BMC (Bombay Municipal Corporation) has forcibly vacated her house and sealed it.

Sharing this video, a user wrote – “Krishna Sarika, who lives near Bhendi Bazaar in South Mumbai, has been forcibly evicted from her house by Muslims. Hope @CMOMaharashtra Shri @mieknathshinde & @Dev_Fadnavis will help the needy. Hope Mumbai does not become Mewat.

At the same time, many tweets have been made on this matter from the account named Krishna Sarika.

Fact Check:

DFRAC team found a tweet by journalist Dinesh Maurya. According to Dinesh’s tweet, BMC (Bombay Municipal Corporation) has taken action against Krishna Sarika. Dinesh quoted Mumbai Police saying that Krishna’s grandfather and father used to work in BMC. Father retired in 2009. In such a situation, the house allotted by BMC was to be vacated under the rules but the family did not vacate the house. What about BMC in so many years The arrears increased to Rs 41 lakh.

According to Dinesh, when the family did not fill 41 lakhs of BMC, BMC first issued a notice as per the rules and then got the house vacated. Police will issue notice to the girl who made the false claim in the video and the person who tweeted this video.
