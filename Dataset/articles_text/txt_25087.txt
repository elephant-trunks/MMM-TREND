Years old tradition of @MumbaiPolice, paying respect at Mahim Dargah is viral falsely relating it to politics.

A video clip is viral in which few men in police uniform are seen saluting Pir Makhdoom Ali Mahimi at Mahim Dargah in Mumbai.

Following text is viral with the video –

“मुंबई पोलीस ये क्या कर रही है?😡😡पीर हजरत मकदूम शाह को सलामी..👇👇👇

यकीन करिये शिवसेना(शवसेना) अब अपने अंतिम पड़ाव पे है..👇👇👇”

Translation – “What is Mumbai Police doing ? Saluting Pir Hazrat Makhdoom Shah. Believe me, Shivsena (corpse army) is on last stage.”

Truth

Although the video is real, but this ritual by ‘Mahim‘ Police is decades old, not new and is not related to any party or politics.

“Once a year on Mahimi’s Urs, thousands from around the city, not least the Mumbai police force, come to pay their respects and seek his blessings. The Mumbai police force has the privilege of laying the first chadar, or decorative tomb covering, of the Urs in Mahimi’s respect.

The Mahim police station, about 200 metres away from the dargah, has been built on the site where Mahimi is said to have lived. A green steel cupboard in the Senior Inspector’s room is said to contains the saint’s possessions. During the ten days of the fair held each year to honour Mahimi, the office is thrown open for devotees.” – The Scroll

Following videos are from years before Shiva Sena came in power –

Times of India –

So it’s the Mahim Police, not entire Mumbai Police, who had been paying respect to the Pir for decades, so it’s not related to any Party or politics.
