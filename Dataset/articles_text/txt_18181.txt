Indian rapper Aditya Tiwari, also known by his stage name MC Kode, has allegedly gone missing after posting a cryptic message in an Instagram story, hinting at mental distress from recent events. A week earlier, Tiwari was called out after a five-year old video of him resurfaced where he makes obscene references against Hindu religious texts.

On May 26, OpIndia published articles on its English and Hindi sites, calling out Tiwari for the five-year old video and followed it up with another story on May 28, detailing Tiwari's sexist and misogynist remarks made during past 'rap-battles' with other rappers. While Tiwari apologised and deleted all such content from his social media platforms, his apology was dismissed by several users and also called fake,

The incident also became a top trend on Twitter, with several right wing Twitter handles calling him out and outraging against him, and also trolling him.



Read in a report this video was released in 2016. This means this fellow Aditya Tiwari aka MC Kode went on to have a good career, being a mentor for a @redbull event and all. Now if someone had said this about the holy book of second largest majority, career would have been over https://t.co/523L1xmaIO — Swati Goel Sharma (@swati_gs) May 27, 2021

Tiwari responded with an apology on his Instagram stories, and claimed that he is deleting all his songs and will 'stay out of the beautiful hip-hop culture'. He also mentioned that nine brands have cancelled their endorsements towards him along with three gigs being cancelled, leaving him with no income.





Following his alleged disappearance, and Instagram post hinting at a distressed mental state, Twitter handles mocked him and his alleged disappearance. User Ankur Singh who is followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP IT cell chief, Amit Malviya and by other BJP leaders, posted a tweet claiming if Tiwari jumps he may be called Mc Koode.

If MC Kode jumps, will it be called MC Koode? — Ankur Singh (@iAnkurSingh) June 2, 2021

To this, Twitter account @BefittingFacts operated by Shashank Singh, replied, "If he hangs, will be called MC Jhoole", ridiculing Tiwari's distress. Singh whose previous account was called @pokershash was suspended from Twitter for targeted harassment of Preeti Menon, an Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson.

Post Shares Old Photo Of Rohingya Child, Falsely Claims Tiwari's Body Recovered



Hours after Tiwari's Instagram story, Twitter user Monishism (@MonishJourno) posted a photo of a dead body with the claim that it shows Tiwari's body recovered by the police by the banks of the Yamuna River, near the Millennium Park Bus Stand.







This claim is false; the image shows the dead body of a Rohingya boy who drowned during a tragic capsizing of a boat carrying refugees from Rohingya in September, 2017. The photo, which can be triggering for some, can be found in this visual report on the event by NBC News. At the time of writing this article, Tiwari's whereabouts remain unknown.
