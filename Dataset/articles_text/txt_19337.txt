A set of two viral graphics claiming Hindi news channel Aaj Tak reported drinking tulsi and noni juice will help prevent the Novel Coronavirus, are false as the images are poorly photoshopped.



BOOM found multiple discrepancies in the fonts, timestamp, ticker of the viral screenshots and those that the channel actually uses and concluded that the images are fake.

Furthermore, the World Health Organisation has said nothing about the properties of tulsi or noni juice in fighting the virus.
