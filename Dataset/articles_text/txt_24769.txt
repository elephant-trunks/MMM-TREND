New Delhi: On March 6, 2018, the Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) tweeted that the state had seen more communal clashes than Kerala, and only Hindus had been victims in all communal clashes Karnataka had seen in the last five years.

“Does it not indicate at [sic] systematic and planned execution of Hindus at the hands of Islamic jihadi radicals,” the Karnataka BJP tweeted about the Congress government’s rule in the state.

We fact-checked the claims and found one to be false and another unclear.

Claim 1: Karnataka has surpassed Kerala in incidents of communal clashes.

Karnataka has surpassed Kerala in instances of communal clashes. It is saddening to see the loss of face of our dear state. The Cong curse on Karnataka must be washed off at the earliest. #JihadiMuktaKarnataka must be built at the earliest. — BJP Karnataka (@BJP4Karnataka) March 6, 2018

Fact: False. Karnataka has been among the top five states by the number of communal incidents reported since 2008, IndiaSpend reported on February 9, 2018.

In this period, Kerala has reported far fewer incidents and injuries, home ministry data show (click here, here, here, here and here).

Before Siddaramaiah was sworn in as the chief minister on May 13, 2013, the state was ruled by the BJP under three chief ministers--B.S. Yeddyurappa, D.V. Sadananda Gowda and Jagadish Shettar--during its five-year rule beginning 2008.

Claim 2: Only Hindus have been victims in the communal clashes Karnataka has seen in last 5 years. “Does it not indicate at [sic] systematic and planned execution of Hindus at the hands of Islamic jihadi radicals?”

Only Hindus have been victims in all communal clashes Karnataka has seen in last 5 years. Does it not indicate at systematic and planned execution of Hindus at the hands of Islamic jihadi radicals? We need to get rid of pro jihadi Siddu and create #JihadiMuktaKarnataka — BJP Karnataka (@BJP4Karnataka) March 6, 2018

Fact: Unclear. There is no religion-wise break-up of victims of communal clashes in the state in the last five years.
