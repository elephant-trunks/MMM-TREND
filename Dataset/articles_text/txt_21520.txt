The Kabul airport has witnessed chaotic scenes since the Taliban took over the Afghan capital, with desperate families trying to flee the country. Pictures of foreign soldiers helping women and children cross over the barricades have flooded social media.

Amid this, a picture of a soldier holding a baby is circulating on social media with the claim that this is a United States soldier rescuing an Afghan kid. Several Instagram and Facebook users have posted the picture with the caption, “US soldiers rescuing children in Afghanistan”.

It is true that the US army and forces of other countries are helping distressed Afghan citizens trying to flee the country. But India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the man in the viral picture is a British corporal from the parachute regiment.

Using reverse image search, we found a “Sky News” article with the same picture. The headline of the article says, “Afghanistan: The story behind the picture British soldier says image of him with child in Kabul sums up what the guys are doing”.

As per this report, the soldier seen in the viral image with a child was filmed by Sky News. He is a British corporal from the parachute regiment.

The picture was part of a sequence filmed by Sky News camera operator Toby Nash at Kabul airport. Later, the Sky News team met the corporal who explained the incident. “The baby got passed over, to the side over the razor wire. First came the baby and then came the mum and the pram, but she was on her own,” he said.

The British Army is also helping Afghan citizens in this challenging environment along with other foreign forces at the Kabul airport.

As per the Sky News report, the British soldier was not even aware when the photograph was taken. He said he was only doing his job, no different than all his colleagues. He hopes the baby and her mother made it out safely and can begin a new life wherever it may be.
