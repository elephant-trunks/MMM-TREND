An image of Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, and other prominent Indian ministers of that time having a meal is going viral on social media. It has been claimed that it was the first Iftar party of independent India

However, Fact Crescendo found this image to be miscaptioned.

This was not an Iftar party but a banquet organized by Sardar Patel in honor of C. Raj Gopalchari who was elected as Governor-General of India.

WHAT’S THE CLAIM?

Along with the viral image, it is written that the “first Iftar party after independence in 1947 hosted by first education minister Maulana Abul Kalam Azad to his colleagues Jawaharlal Nehru, B. R. Ambedkar, and Dr. Rajendra Prasad.”

FACT CHECK

Google reverses image search led us to an image available on the photo stock website Alamy. It was taken in June 1948. The caption in Marathi with the image reads: “Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, Jawaharlal Nehru, Maulana Azad, and other ministers attended the banquet in honor of Dr. Chakravarti Rajagopalachari who was elected as the Governor-General of India.”

Another image of this banquet is also published on BBC News Marathi. It notes that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had hosted this banquet on the occasion of Chakravarti Gopalchari’s election as the first Governor-General of India. First prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, and other minster were present at the time.

CONCLUSION

Thus, it is clear that the viral image is not of the first Iftar party organized in independent India organized. It was a banquet organized by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on the occasion of Chakravarti Gopalchari’s election as Governor-General of India.
