A viral photo of newly elected Rajya Sabha member and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Raghav Chadha with coloured hair and make-up at the Lakmé Fashion Week in Delhi, is morphed.



The digitally altered image shows Chadha with burgundy hair, eye shadow and lipstick.



On March 27, Chadha walked the ramp for designer Pawan Sachdeva wearing an all-black outfit at the FDCI X Lakmé Fashion Week in New Delhi. The 33-year-old politician was also a showstopper at the event.

Filmmaker Ashoke Pandit tweeted the doctored photo asking his followers to guess whose image it was.
