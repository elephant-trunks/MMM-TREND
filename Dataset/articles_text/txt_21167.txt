The hijab row that started in Karnataka has hit bollywood as well. On social media, a screenshot of actor Sara Ali Khan’s tweet about the issue has gone viral.

Several social media users shared the alleged screenshot of the tweet from the handle “@WhoSaraAli”. The Hindi text roughly translates to, “Muslim girls don’t usually don burqas in Hindu-dominated areas because they feel safe there. It is only in Muslim-dominated regions, localities where they wear hijabs because they are vulnerable to sexual harassment there, even from family members.”

AFWA PROBE

While investigating the claim, we decided to first check the Twitter profile @WhoSaraAli. We discovered that such a Twitter handle does not exist at all.

Next, we checked Sara Ali Khan’s verified Twitter account @SaraAliKhan. We compared tweets from Sara Ali Khan’s verified handle and the viral image. This revealed glaring differences.

With the help of Advanced Twitter Search, we searched but found nothing tweeted by Khan that resembled the contents of the viral screenshot. And lastly, when we searched on Google, we found no news report on Khan’s comments on the hijab row.

Thus, we can conclude that this claim is a lie. The screenshot of the tweet used in this post is morphed. Sara Ali Khan did not say anything of this sort.
