A Twitter post with a screenshot of a tweet criticising the current state of Indian banks is being shared widely despite the fact that it was from a parody account of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The post said in Hindi: “Leave aside what is inside the Taj Mahal, Qutub Minar and Gyanvapi. Look at what’s left inside the Reserve Bank and the rest of the banks!”

ताजमहल, कुतुबमीनार और ज्ञानवापी के भीतर क्या है यह छोड़ो। रिजर्व बैंक और बाकी बैंकों के भीतर क्या कुछ बचा है यह देखो! — DR. MANMOHAN SINGH (Parody) (@aryanzalwar) May 22, 2022

माननीय पूर्व प्रधानमंत्री जी सभी बैंकों की दुर्दशा बहुत ही दयनीय बद से बदतर हो गया है लेकिन भारत के जनता धर्म मजहब जात पात हिंदू मियां पार्टी पॉलिटिक्स में परिवारवाद और वंशवाद में उलझे हुए हैं और उनका हक और अधिकार सरेआम हनन किया जा रहा है मैं सहमत हूं आपकी बातों से — Jivach Kumar hajari (@HajariJivach) May 22, 2022

It was shared here and here.

FACT CHECK

When we checked Google, no such comments were made by the former Prime Minister, especially on how the banks are being emptied.

A further check revealed that Manmohan Singh does not maintain any twitter account and the viral tweet was made from a fan account. The Twitter handle shows that it is from ‘@aryanzalwar’, where the bio section clearly mentioned that it is a fan page of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

Hence the claim is false. Neither Manmohan Singh tweeted this message criticising the current state of Indian banks, nor the congress Party made any such statement officially.

However, in February 2022, Manmohan Singh criticised the current government for its economic policies but never made them either RBI-centric or on Indian banks.

Claim: Not what is inside the Taj Mahal, Qutub Minar and Gyanvapi but look at what’s left inside the RBI and the rest of the banks, tweeted former PM Manmohan Singh.

Conclusion: Though a parody account, it triggered debate on twitter.
