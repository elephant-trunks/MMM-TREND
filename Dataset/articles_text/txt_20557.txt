A Video in the name of communal riots is all-around on the internet where a woman is seen getting a beating by a group of men on the road. The woman is seen screaming in pain in the video for help but no one present there is coming forward to save the woman from the violence.

To our amusement, the inspector present at the time of violence too choose to be a mute spectator.

People are sharing this all over the globe under the captions like, “If this is the condition of law and order under the fascist Hindutva regime, let them know that their barbarism is being watched and every human right’s violation will be harshly accounted for.Civilised world won’t allow this Jungle Raj.” And questioning the secularity of India as can be seen under this tweet.

Fact Check:

By reverse image search and using different keyphrases we found the article related to this incident in the newspaper of Dainik Bhaskar two years before. That tells us that this incident is from adhinpur UP, and has nothing to do with the communal riots, as it was a domestic violence case over a land dispute.

All four accused are under arrest and the two policemen were suspended over this issue as stated by the newspaper.

Conclusion:

The claims are fake, as the woman was not beaten in communal riots but over domestic violence. Hence, this is clear that many same kinds of fake videos are spreading in the name of communalism in other parts of the world to defame India.

Claim review: Muslim women getting a beating went viral, in the name of communal Riots.
