A post on social media claims that there will be a full Blue Moon on Halloween (October 31) for the first time in 76 years.

“There’s going to be a full blue moon on 31 October 2021 that is Halloween for the first time in 76 years [sic],” reads the viral post.

However, India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. There will be no Blue Moon on October 31.
