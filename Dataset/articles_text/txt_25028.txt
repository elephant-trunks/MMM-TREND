Yesterday, ‘Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna’ Award was renamed to ‘The Major Dhyanchand Khel Ratna Award’, following which many prominent people, ministers tweeted a poster/image thanking PM Modi.

PM Modi tweeted –

“I have been getting many requests from citizens across India to name the Khel Ratna Award after Major Dhyan Chand. I thank them for their views. Respecting their sentiment, the Khel Ratna Award will hereby be called the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award! Jai Hind!“

That is the Param Vir Chakra and not Khel Ratna Award.
