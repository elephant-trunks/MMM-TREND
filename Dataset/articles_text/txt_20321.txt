Videos and photos with strange facts keep going viral on social media. Here, sometimes a human being is made into a machine, and sometimes a human is called a robot. A video with a similar claim is going viral. In this video, two women are doing Bharatnatyam. Social media users are calling these two women Chinese robots.

A user named Narinder Gupta wrote on Facebook – “Watch this dance carefully. The dance is being performed at Disneyland in Shanghai*. *These two are not human dancers, but two Chinese-made robots*. *The duration of the dance is only five minutes. But the waiting time to buy a ticket to watch this dance is 4 hours. The ticket price to watch this dance is 499 yuan, which is equivalent to 75 dollxars*. *The facial expressions of the robots are perfect and it is difficult to distinguish them from real humans.”

Fact Check:

To check the reality of the viral video, we reverse searched some of the frames of the video. On searching, we found a link to a YouTube video. A YouTube channel named Indian Raga posted this video on August 11, 2017. Moreover, the title of the video is titled as “ Vahana Alarippu : Bharatanatyam Dance | Best of Indian Classical Dance” has been given.

As the title of this video suggests, it is not from China but from India. Then, we checked the description of this video. Investigation revealed that this Bharatnatyam has been performed by Sophia Salingaros and Isha Parupudi. Sofia is also the choreographer of this dance.

Conclusion:

Therefore, DFRAC fact check proves that the claims being made by social media users are false and misleading. Because this Bharatnatyam is not being done by Chinese robots but by two dancers.

Claim- Chinese robot did Bharatnatyam
