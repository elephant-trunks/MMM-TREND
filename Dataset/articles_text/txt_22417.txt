This special report takes viewers onto the sets of the upcoming Tamil movie 'Parashakti', starring Shiva Karthikeyan, Ravi, and Sri Leela. The film is meticulously recreating the era of the 1950s and 1960s in Tamil Nadu, focusing on a pivotal moment in the state's history. The central theme appears to be the anti-Hindi agitation, as the report highlights props and set pieces depicting student protests and the political climate that led to the rise of the Dravidian government. The report notes that 'this movie is expected to touch the part because that anti-Hindi agitation paved the way for the Dravidian government'. Viewers get a glimpse of nostalgic elements from the period, including Goli Soda bottles, pull rickshaws, a vintage Chevrolet, and recreations of old railway and radio stations, all contributing to the historical setting of the film which is expected to release on Pongal 2026.
