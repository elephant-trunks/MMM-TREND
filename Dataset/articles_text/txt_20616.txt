Fact Check

After cross-checking the tweet we got a tweet by Mahoba Police about denying the claims made by the media houses like Dainik Jagran and Hindustan. They clearly said that the woman who got raped was not a Female Constable in Mahoba Police Station and attached an official note to rectify the news made on Mahoba Police. The woman Indeed went through sexual harassment but her identity is not of a Female Constable.

Furthermore, UP Police Fact check also republished the post and refuted the news that victim is a Female Constable at Mahoba Police Station.

Conclusion: Therefore, the news is fake and misleading as the victim is not a female constable at Mahoba District.
