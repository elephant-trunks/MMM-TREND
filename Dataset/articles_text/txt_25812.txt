Popular Punjabi singer Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu, also known as Sidhu Moose Wala, was shot dead on May 29, 2022 in Jawaharke Village, Mansa district of Punjab. Attack on Moose Wala came just a day after his security cover was pruned by the Punjab government.

Against this backdrop, a video in which a group of men can be seen firing at someone is being widely shared on social media linking it to Sidhu Moose Wala’s killing.

The video is shared on Facebook with a caption in the Punjabi language, “ਵਾਹਿਗੁਰੂ ਜੀ, ਆਹ ਵੇਖੋ ਮੂਸੇ ਵਾਲੇ ਨੂੰ ਮਾਰਨ ਵਾਲਿਆ ਕਿਵੇ ਹਮਲਾ ਕੀਤਾ”

(English translation: Waheguru Ji, see how the killer of Musa attacked)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim and found it to be FALSE.

Using the InVid Tool, we extracted keyframes from the viral video and performed a Reverse Image Search. This directed us to several YouTube channels that carried a clearer version of the same viral video in 2021. The descriptor of one of the videos reads, “Badnam Gabru song | in Neeraj Bawana attack on Road Police”. Check here and here.

Neeraj Bawana is a notorious gangster who is currently imprisoned in Delhi’s high-security Tihar jail. Bawana has lately made headlines for allegedly promising revenge for Sidhu Moose Wala’s murder.

We saw that in one of the replies to a YouTube video, a social media claimed that the clip is from a web series named ‘Shukla The Tiger’ which is based on the life of late gangster Prakash Shukla. We searched and found the web series on MX Player. Around 6 minutes into the eighth episode, we can see similar visuals seen in the viral video.

Thus, it is evident from the above information that visuals from a web series are being falsely linked to Sidhu Moose Wala’s killing.
