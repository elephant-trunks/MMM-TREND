BJP digital and social media ecosystem usually share all of the PM Modi’s rallies. By looking into it, we found a tweet shared on 1 April by BJP’s official Twitter handle, which features the same video as in viral posts.

The video is from PM Modi’s election campaign rally in Jaynagar, West Bengal.
