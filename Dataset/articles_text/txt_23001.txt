Veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah reignited intolerance debate by saying that the society has become so communally polarised that he is scared for his children. While most people are arguing over the veracity of his statement, some have twisted it altogether to malign him. People are also sharing quotes attributed to Shah, which he never made. According to the claims, Shah also said "India is a pathetic country, not worth living".

A screenshot of DBN news is being shared by many on social media which quotes Shah as saying, "India is not a country worth living in, I am worried for my children, India is a pathetic country."

DBN news stands for Dainik Bharat, which also published an article that carried the exactly same headline as being shared in the viral screenshot. Similar messages were doing the rounds at various Facebook profiles; some of which also claimed that Shah called "India a dangerous country".

India Today Fact Check found that the claims attributed to Shah by Dainik Bharat and others were fabricated.

In an interview to 'Karwan-e-Mohabbat India' YouTube channel, Shah talked about the communal environment in the country. The original interview can be seen here.

In the interview, Shah can be seen saying, "We have already witnessed that the death of a cow has more significance than that of a police officer in today's India. I feel anxious for my children because they don't have a religion. I had received religious education as a child, Ratna [his wife] is from a liberal household, so she had received next to none and we chose not to give religious education to our children... I feel anxious for my children because tomorrow if mob surrounds them and asks 'Are you a Hindu or a Muslim?' they will have no answer. These matter don't scare me, they make me angry."

Nowhere in the video, Shah said anything against India. He never used the word "pathetic" or "dangerous country" for India.
