A video is getting viral on social media. Users are claiming that some Muslim women have got arrested in MP’s Khargaon.

Users are also claiming that these women have attacked Hindu women with stones and petrol.

Fact check

After doing the cross-checking, we found that the video is from the year 2020. When a group of people attacked doctors in Moradabad.

India Blooms News Service also posted the video on 15th April 2020. When the entire town attacked the health care workers and doctors who were serving during the time of Covid-19.
