An image is widely shared on social media, showing the portrait of Dr BR Ambedkar and his wife Savita Ambedkar on a bus. Sharing this image, social media users claim that Dr Ambedkar was honoured by putting a picture on the city bus in Columbia, US.

The text embedded on the image reads: “कोलंबिया (अमेरिका) की सड़कों पर दौड़ती सिटी बस पर बाबा साहब का चित्र यह असली सम्मान है, अमेरिका आज भी बाबा साहब को अपना आदर्श मानता है। किंतु अपने यहाँ अधिकांश बहुजन भी बाबा साहब के मिशन से भटके हुये है। जागरुक हो। जय भीम।” (English translation: The picture of Baba Saheb on the city bus running on the streets of Columbia (US) is a real honour. America still considers Baba Saheb as its ideal. But most of the Bahujans here are deviated from the mission of Baba Saheb. Be aware, Jai Bheem)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim, and found it to be MISLEADING.

We did a keyword search, but could not find any recent credible media report that corroborated the viral claim.

Doing a simple Reverse Image Search directed us to Wikimedia Commons website that carried the original image. The details suggest that this picture is of a tourist bus in Bath, Somerset, England. The image found on Wikimedia does not contain the poster of Dr Ambedkar. More such images of the bus can be seen here and here.

Below is the comparison between the viral image and the original image.

Searching further, we found the image of Dr Ambedkar and his wife published in a blog post in 2017.

Thus, it is evident from the above information that an altered image is being shared as the image of Dr Ambedkar and his wife Savita Ambedkar put up on the US city bus.
