Fact Check

After performing a reverse search image on the picture we found out that this picture is not from Gujarat but from a government primary school in Salt, Almora in Uttarakhand.

Jagran and Amar Ujala have also done a report on the same in March 2018 and August 2019 respectively.

Hence it clearly states that this picture is used to mislead people and to mock Gujarat government and BJP.
