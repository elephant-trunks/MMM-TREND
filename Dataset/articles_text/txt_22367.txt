A Facebook post about experts predicting major economic downfall due to coronavirus is getting traction on social media. The content of the post has been wrongly attributed to industrialist Ratan Tata.

India Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that Ratan Tata has no connection with the content of the viral post on Facebook.

Debasis Ray, Corporate Communication, Tata Trust clarified that Ratan Tata has not given any such statement or penned any such article.

We also ran a search on the internet and found the same article published on a website named purplerealtors, but without any attribution to Ratan Tata. The article was published on April 9, 2020, on the website.

There is no trace of the article on any of Tata’s social media accounts and no other publications have carried any reports on the same.

Meanwhile, Ratan Tata donated Rs 500 crore towards battling Covid-19, while Tata Sons donated an additional Rs 1,000 crore later.

Stating Covid-19 one of the toughest challenges, Ratan Tata on March 28 tweeted that he has committed Rs 500 crore for the development of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for the frontline medical staff, ventilators, testing kits and modular treatment facilities.

The COVID 19 crisis is one of the toughest challenges we will face as a race. The Tata Trusts and the Tata group companies have in the past risen to the needs of the nation. At this moment, the need of the hour is greater than any other time. pic.twitter.com/y6jzHxUafM — Ratan N. Tata (@RNTata2000) March 28, 2020

To sum up, it is clear that Ratan Tata has not written the viral article, nor has he issued any such statement.
