Apart from this when we searched on Javed Akhtar’s verified Twitter account to find any such statements made by him, we came across his response given on 12 May 2019 at one of Shabana Azmi’s tweet.

It is totally rubbish Shabana has not made any such statement . No politician no political party can make a patriot Like her even imagine leaving her motherland INDIA !!! — Javed Akhtar (@Javedakhtarjadu) May 12, 2019

When Shabana Azmi was trolled in a tweet for falsifying the alleged statement that she will leave the country if Modi gets re-elected as the PM, Javed Akhtar took a stand for her by denying the claim.

‘EconomicTimes’ published a news dated 11th May 2019, where Shabana Azmi stated that these statements are ‘pure fabrication’. To read the entire article, please click on the link given below.
