Spread the truth:

Few fake photos which were viral last year claimed to be newly inaugurated bus stand in Rajkot are viral again but this time as Vadodara bus stand which was already inaugurated in Feb 2014.

India's first Airport like Bus terminal in Vadodara Gujarat which was inaugurated by PM @narendramodi in February 2018. Give Modi Ji time and he will give us development in return. pic.twitter.com/hHtOrlCwHb — Puneet Sharma (@iSharmaPuneet) April 19, 2018

Mr. Puneet Sharma, who is followed by many verified twitter handles have falsely claimed

“India’s first Airport like Bus terminal in Vadodara Gujarat which was inaugurated by PM @ narendramodi in February 2018. Give Modi Ji time and he will give us development in return.”

To support his claim, in reply he posted a news article

Modi inaugurates 'airport-like' bus terminal in Vadodara – Vadodara bus terminal with 'airport-like''feel-https://t.co/zZl4btfonG — Puneet Sharma (@iSharmaPuneet) April 19, 2018

Now you’ll say, oh, yes, it’s there, so it’s not a lie, but yes it is. Mostly people will be satisfied with the link itself, wont click on it but if one does, he will find the truth.

The Article is of Feb 2014, i.e. 4 years ago which can’t be seen in this tweet

The point here is, Mr. Puneet Sharma seems to have tweeted this Fake News intentionally as SMHoaxSlayer calling out his tweet has more RTs. So He must have noticed but the tweets is still there, no deletion, no correction at all.

True, but it was inaugurated 4 years ago.

The photo with Modi Ji is from inauguration of Kiran Super Speciality hospital in Surat, the right one is of Vadodara but year 2014

The bottom two images are computer generated as a model for Rajkot which many fell for as real. https://t.co/9lN0DCmCWK — SM Hoax Slayer (@SMHoaxSlayer) April 19, 2018

Following is the screenshot of photos viral again which was viral last year and debunked too.

While PM Modi ji just performed Bhoomi Pujan and these photos were computer generated as how the bus stand will look like after completion, many fell for it e.g Babul Supriyo –

This is not an Airport•It's not in London or New York either•It's the New Bus Stand inaugrated in Rajkot, Gujarat 👏👏 pic.twitter.com/uSrLo9PfJ1 — Babul Supriyo (@SuPriyoBabul) April 19, 2017

The following one also is from Vadodara Bus Stand which was inaugurated in Feb 2014 and which is Falsely claimed by Mr. Puneet Sharma as Feb 2018 i.e this year
