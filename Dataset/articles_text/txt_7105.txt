A video through a post is being widely shared on social media claiming that Arnab Goswami was seen dancing after Uddhav Thackeray’s resignation as CM of Maharashtra. Let us fact-check the claim made in the post.

Claim: Video of Arnab Goswami dancing after Uddhav Thackeray’s resignation as CM of Maharashtra. Fact: Though we could not find when exactly the video was taken, the video has been shared on the internet at least since 2010. We could not find any such recent videos of Arnab Goswami dancing after the resignation of Uddhav Thackeray as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.

When reverse image search is done on the screenshots of the video, a video with similar visuals was found uploaded on YouTube in 2010. The YouTube video was cut at 3:15 timeframe to make the viral video. According to the YouTube video, the visuals were from a party organised at the launch of ‘Times Now’ news channel. Before launching Republic TV, Arnab Goswami worked at Times Now as a prime time Anchor. Times Now was launched in 2006.

Though we could not find when exactly the video was taken, the video had been shared on the internet at least since 2010. We could not find any such recent videos of Arnab Goswami dancing after the resignation of Uddhav Thackeray as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra.

To sum it up, old video of Arnab Goswami dancing is falsely shared as recent.
