FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did the fact-check, and found it to be fake.

On searching with appropriate keywords, we found no reports of Shinde being drunk while talking to the media.

We also found a video uploaded by The Economic Times on June 22, 2022, with a title: “Maharashtra political crisis: Eknath Shinde claims support of 40 MLAs, says ‘haven’t left Balasaheb Thackeray’s Shiv Sena'”

The caption associated with the video reads: “Maharashtra Minister Eknath Shinde has claimed the support of 40 MLAs amid the Maharashtra political crisis. While speaking to the media at the Surat International Airport, 58-year-old Shinde, an MLA from Thane district, said: “We have not left Balasaheb Thackeray’s Shiv Sena and will not leave it. We have been following Balasaheb’s Hindutva and will carry it further.”

We also found a Twitter user who shared a full-length video with a caption: “एकनाथ शिंदे दारू पिऊन आहेत असा विडिओ सध्या सामाज माध्यमांवर व्हायरल होतोय, त्यात काहीही तथ्य नाही तो सुरत येथील विडिओ अर्धवट एडिट करून मुद्दामून व्हायरल केला जातोय . हा घ्या तो खरा पुर्ण विडिओ.” (English translation: The video of Eknath Shinde drinking alcohol is currently going viral on social media… there is no fact in it. Take this real full video.) In the full-length video, we can see that Shinde speaks about carrying forward Balasaheb’s Hindutva.

Hence, we can ascertain that the viral video is being shared with a false claim.
