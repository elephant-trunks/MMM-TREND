Multiple users have shared this image on Facebook. The caption in Hindi to one such claim translates as, “It is far better to bear the extra cost of petrol rather than voting to a party that raises anti-India slogans and waves Pakistani flags in their rallies.”

The claim comes in the backdrop of rising fuel prices across the country.
