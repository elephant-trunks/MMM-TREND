Truth

The viral image is edited, not real.

Lately, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has been in news for his expenditure on publicity via advertisements which supports this viral fake image.

To check the credibility of the image, Google reverse Image search done showed different results.

The image is actually an edited copy of the same banner with different text put up in November 2020.

Tweet with the original image is as follows:

The tweet below is from Prateek Som – Advocate Supreme Court, National Spokesperson Jannayak Janta Party.

Banners of @ArvindKejriwal at every 15-20 meters. Congratulations for what? For repair work of road. Is he a CM or what? Only advertisement no work pic.twitter.com/GcgkBKdGrL — Prateek som (@Prateeksom2) November 8, 2020

The tweet below says “Congratulations to all. To save everyone from the Corona pandemic, Delhi’s roads are being repaired. Special quality elements are used which will the increase the mileage of vehicles along with boosting the immunity of the drivers. This will help generate Anti-Covid plasma in your blood”

As one can see in the image below that the left hand side edited image’s clarity is very poor. Delhi Sarkar’s logo in the down is not quite visible in the edited image. The colors in the left hand side image is also very bright which is not the case in reality. Hence, it states that the image is modified for political propaganda.

This is an article published by The Indian Express which talks about the reconstruction of the Rohtak road after nine years. The time gap is huge and hence, there were banners put up to promote the initiative.
