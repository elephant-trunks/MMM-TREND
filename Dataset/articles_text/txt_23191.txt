It was widely shared by Congress units all over the country. However, a deeper look at these images showed several deficiencies that Digiteye India team took up for fact-checking. The results of Google Reverse Image search showed that it was indeed an old image of Rahul Gandhi’s rally in Nagpur in 2016, alongwith Sonia Gandhi, then Congress President on the occasion of 125th birth anniversary of BR Ambedkar.

An image taken by Nagpur Today was published by the publication and shared on social media too. Here’s one such message shared on Twitter on April 12, 2016 by Congress supporter Gaurav Pandhi.

The crowd that gathered in Nagpur yesterday to hear Rahul Gandhi & Sonia Gandhi. Do you see that? ? pic.twitter.com/ucZs2VYptV — Gaurav Pandhi (गौरव पांधी) (@GauravPandhi) April 12, 2016

Conclusion: Though pictures belonged to the Congress Party rallies, using old pictures to portray them to indicate the present rally is misrepresentation of facts and our rating of this claim is ???.
