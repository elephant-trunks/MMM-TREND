Several western Indian states have been hit hard by heavy monsoon rainfall. About a hundred people have died in rain-related incidents in Maharashtra. A video of a bridge, supposedly from this region, collapsing has gone viral on social media.

The video shows a massive block of the bridge tipping over crumbling into a river as turbulent muddy waters exert force on it. Those sharing the video claimed the bridge connected the cities Akkalkuva and Ankleshwar in Maharashtra and Gujarat respectively. People also claimed this incident had disrupted transportation between these two cities.

AFWA’s investigation found the video was nearly two-years-old, and not recent. Also, this video is from Jammu.
