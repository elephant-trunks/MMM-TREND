On October 16,2021, many users on Twitter began sharing an image of Akhilesh Yadav distributing food on what looks like an occasion.

In the image, Yadav can be seen giving food to a girl while others eat on the floor. Users began to claim that Yadav was wearing shoes during a Navratri ritual popularly known as ‘Kanjak’ where girls are invited home for ‘bhojan’. People called this act blasphemous on the part of Yadav.

Fact-Check:

A simple reverse image search revealed that the image is old and was posted by the official handle of Akhilesh Yadav in 2016. According to the caption, the photo was taken at the launch of Yadav’s Hausala Nutritious Scheme which aimed to provide hot meals to pregnant women and children.

Since the image had nothing to do with navratri, this claim is fake.
