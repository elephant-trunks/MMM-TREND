Recently, a video of Yogi Adityanath and Jyotiraditya Scindia receiving a relic is going viral on social media.

The video shows a group of individuals carrying the relic out of an aircraft and then carried across the field. The claim is being shared with the caption that this is the rock that Sita sat on in Ashok Vatika in Sri Lanka.

According to Ramayana, Sita was kept captive in Ashok Vatika by Ravana. According to the users, this rock has been gifted to Ayodhya and will be put in the new Ram Mandir.

The video was posted by Ashish Jaggi who is followed by the likes of Kapil Mishra. His video has over 3,00,000 which is staggering.

Fact-Check:

However, after reverse searching the keyframes of the video we found the original source of the video. Union Minister of Culture and Tourism, G Kishan Reddy posted the video along with pictures of the actual event on October 20,2021. The caption reads,”Performed a ceremonial worship on the arrival of the Sacred Buddha relic from Sri Lanka on the occasion of Ashwin Poornima Also welcomed Buddhists Monks on their arrival. The exposition of Holy Relic will take place during celebrations of Abhidhamma Day today at Kushinagar, UP.”

We also found news reports of the event stating that a Sri Lankan flight was welcomed at Kushinagar airport with 123 delegates and the relics to commemorate Abhidhamma Day.

Since the relics were in now way associated with the Ramayana or Sita, this claim is fake.
