Amid the ongoing tension between India and Pakistan, social media on both sides have become hyperactive. Pakistani media and its netizens have now claimed that Air Marshal Chandrashekharan Hari Kumar has been sacked after the Indian Air Force (IAF) lost its fighter aircraft to Pakistan in the recent standoff.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that Air Marshal Kumar was not fired but he retired on February 28, 2019 after an illustrious career spanning over 39 years. His last stint was as the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Western Air Command for about two years and he is now succeeded by Air Marshal Raghunath Nambiar.
