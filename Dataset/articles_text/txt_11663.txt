To verify the claim’s authenticity, we conducted a keyword search on Google for “Ukraine Female Military Officer,” and found the photograph on the stock photo-sharing platform Alamy.

The photograph was taken on August 22, 2021, in Ukraine’s Kyiv, and the woman in the photograph is a Ukrainian female soldier who took part in the rehearsal of the military parade to celebrate Ukraine’s 30 years of Independence Day.

The information section added the caption that says, “Ukrainian smiling female soldier in military uniform on Khreshchatyk street.”

On further verification, we also found no executive role of a vice president in Ukraine. According to a US Dept of the state report, ”Ukraine is a republic with a presidential-parliamentary system of government. The constitution provides for a directly elected president, a prime minister who is appointed by the president and confirmed by parliament, and a unicameral parliament (Verkhovna Rada).”
