Delhi recently witnessed one of the worst communal riots in several decades. Horrific stories of killings and mutilations have spread like wildfire on social media.

As per media reports, the body of Intelligence Bureau operative Ankit Sharma, which was recovered from a canal in violence-hit Chand Bagh, had multiple stab wounds.

A picture of a weeping kid staring at the body of a man has also gone viral. Many on social media such as Facebook page "Narendra Modi Hindu Supporters" shared the picture with a claim that he is the son of Ankit Sharma.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The boy in the viral image is not related to Ankit Sharma. The photo was taken at the funeral of one Mudassir Khan, another victim of the Delhi violence.

Till the filing of this article, the post was shared more than 800 times. The archived version of the post can be seen here.

Using reverse image search, we found that the viral photo was used by several national and international media in articles related to the Delhi violence.

The picture was originally published by news agency "Reuters" on February 27, 2020. The caption of the photo reads, "People mourn next to the body of Muddasir Khan, who was wounded on Tuesday in a clash between people demonstrating for and against a new citizenship law, after he succumbed to his injuries, in a riot-affected area in New Delhi."

As per news reports, 26-year-old Ankit Sharma was unmarried, and therefore, the viral post claiming that the boy in the picture is his son is misleading.

More than 40 people have been killed and over 200 injured in the riots in Delhi.
