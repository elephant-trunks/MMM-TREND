Is saluting with left hand a crime?

As per the Ministry of Defence guideline about ceremonial salutes for the armed forces, it is mentioned that Salutes will be given with the right hand. Where from physical incapacity a right hand salute is impossible the salute is to be given with the left hand.

Therefore, it can be concluded that a nine-year-old photo of Rahul Gandhi saluting the Tricolour with his right hand has been inverted laterally to show as if he was using his left hand.
