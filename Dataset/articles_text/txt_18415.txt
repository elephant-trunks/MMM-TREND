A viral WhatsApp message claiming that KEM hospital in Mumbai has issued a list of medicines for treating symptoms of COVID-19 has been falsely attributed to the hospital.



BOOM spoke to the dean of the hospital who confirmed that the list of medicines were not issued by the hospital.

"This has not been issued by the hospital. KEM's name has been falsely used", Dr. Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM hospital, said.

"Please do not self-medicate or take any of these medicines without a doctor's recommendation or prescription," he added.

King Edwards Memorial (KEM) Hospital is a dedicated COVID-19 facility in Mumbai and is one of the oldest government-run facilities in the city. It currently has 464 isolation beds for confirmed and suspected cases, 229 beds with oxygen cylinders, 89 ICUs and 54 ventilators. Mumbai is the worst affected city with over 55,000 cases and 2,000 deaths.





BOOM received the below message on its WhatsApp helpline.

The message details preventive measures such as eating home-cooked food if a coughing spell arises, along with drinking beverages such as ginger tea, turmeric milk and hot water as immunity boosters. It follows it up with a list of medicines such as Azee for cough, Omee for acidity, Limcee for vitamin C, Dolo for fever and only recommends consulting a doctor for an X-ray after three days.

Furthermore, the message even prescribes medicines after an X-ray is conducted. It recommends Asthakind syrup for cough while Tamiflu medicines if the X-ray detects pneumonia. It further advises an electrocardiogram (ECG) before prescribing hydroxychloroquine. It further goes to claim that all hospitals are following this treatment and those who cannot be admitted into hospitals should self medicate.

It also alleges that private hospitals are cheating COVID-19 patients.

The message is also viral on other social media platforms.

Is The Message Factual?



The medicines mentioned in the list are individually used for treating different ailments. However, doctors only prescribe them after understanding a patient's medical history. Certain medicines could cause side effects in people with existing illnesses. Even for hydroxychloroquine, the government has recommended an ECG before distributing it as a measure of prophylaxis.



There is not enough scientific evidence supporting the use of Arsenicum Album against SARS-CoV-2. BOOM has previously debunked advisories claiming to be from the government, hospitals as well as international organisations that discuss drinking water, drinking hot water, drinking lemon tea as potential tips and tricks to wade off the virus.

There is no definite treatment for COVID-19 so far. The World Health Organization is conducting Solidarity trials with various medicines and treatments such as plasma therapy, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir to ascertain treatments for COVID-19.
