On July 11, Aam Aadmi Party leader Raghav Chadha was appointed chairman of a Punjab government temporary advisory panel. Amid criticism of the appointment — many called Chadha the de facto CM — a “news report” has gone viral with questionable claims.

A screengrab of a news report, allegedly published by Punjabi news outlet Daily Post Punjab, states that Mann approached the party’s high command for a three-month leave following his recent wedding. The screengrab further claimed that in the meantime, Chadha might handle the state’s affairs.

Those sharing the post took digs at the AAP government.

AFWA’s investigation found that the Daily Post Punjab screenshot was digitally manipulated. The news report does not exist and Mann never requested any such leave.

AFWA Probe

The Punjab CM married Dr Gurpreet Kaur on July 7 at his official residence in Chandigarh. The ceremony was attended by close friends and family and even Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal.

While investigating the claim, we first searched for news reports about Mann’s holiday request. We did not find any credible media reports that substantiated this claim.

Further, we found a post on Daily Post Punjab’s official Facebook page calling the viral screengrab “fake.” The outlet claimed that its logo was used to give credence to misinformation.

To further verify if Mann had indeed asked for a three-month leave, AFWA contacted AAP Punjab’s state media head Ayushi Sarswat. She said, “This information is completely wrong.” She added that contrary to the claim, Mann has been attending official meetings since the day after his wedding.

We also found various posts on Mann’s official social media accounts following his wedding where he can be seen working.

Thus, we concluded that the viral claim is false. Mann has not applied for a three-month leave.
