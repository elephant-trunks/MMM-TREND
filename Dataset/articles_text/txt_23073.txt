Partly True

In 2013, ratings agency Moody's relegated India to the pack of 'fragile five' emerging markets, along with Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia and Turkey. In November 2018, Moody's raised India's rating from the lowest investment grade of Baa3 to Baa2, and changed the outlook from stable to positive. Its the first upgrade of India's rating in 14 years. It is likely to unleash a fresh round of foreign portfolio investments and make external commercial borrowings cheaper. However, Moody's warned that India's rating could be downgraded if its fiscal metrics and the outlook for general government fiscal consolidation deteriorate materially.
