These days misleading claims are being made about all the mosques and Mazars in the country including the Taj Mahal, and Qutub Minar. Sometimes a Qutub Minar is described as the Vishnu Pillar, sometimes the Taj Mahal is described as the temple of Tejo Mahadev. Though the court has already advised the petitioners to study MA-PhD on these claims, they are still flooded every day.

The latest controversy is being created over the dargah of the great Sufi saint Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer. Social media users are making many misleading and factless claims about Ajmer Sharif Dargah. An organization named Maharana Pratap Sena has shared some pictures claiming that Ajmer Sharif Dargah has a fake with a swastika’s mark, which takes place in a Hindu temple.

At the Ajmer Sharif Dargah, Dhani Wadhwa wrote: “At the #अजमेर, some foolish Hindus go to the grave of Moinuddin Chishti, who kill lakhs of Hindus in the dargah and palm the shame of thousands of Hindu women. Now the truth is finally coming out.”

A user named Amit Dwivedi wrote- “Under the Ajmer Sharif Dargah was the samadhi of a sadhu of the Nath sect on top of which the dargah was erected. It means samadhi of a Nath yogi there. The truth must come out.”

At the same time, a user named Ajay Pratap Singh wrote – “Now claims that Khwaja Garib Nawaz Dargah of Ajmer is a Hindu temple, demand for archaeological survey. Dig Dig Dig will find shiva in every corner of India. Har Har Mahadev.”

Pt Ravi Shankar Joshi wrote- “The Eklinga temple was demolished and ajmer sharif dargah was built. Meaning to dig up here too. Har Har Mahadev.”

Fact Check:

This claim is being made by social media users on the basis of a photo going viral. Our team searched Google for its fact check. We found a report published on ‘Dainik Bhaskar’ website on May 27, 2022. The report has been titled – “Truth of the claim of the temple at Ajmer Dargah: Swastika marks not found in the premises, the photographs which were not even forged as shown”.

The report states that – “Dainik Bhaskar visited Dargah Sharif and conducted an inquiry. Here the team did not find any part of the dargah of Sufi saint Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Hasan Chishti with a swastik mark on it. Nor were the stones found, as in the picture released by the Maharana Pratap Sena organization.”

An investigation by Dainik Bhaskar revealed several more facts, which confirm the absence of a temple at the Ajmer Sharif Dargah.
