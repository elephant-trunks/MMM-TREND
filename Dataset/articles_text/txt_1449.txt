Norway Burning Al-Quran

For those that don’t understand urdu

Apparently Norway govt started burning Quraans

This imaan stood outside the musjid offered free quraans to anyone that needed

Police entered the musjid while he was reading quraan with shoes and a dog

He asked that they remove the shoes and take out the dog

To protect house of allah he defended.

The cops and dog attacked him and beat him up

The guy speaking asks that the vid should go viral and make this incident known around the world
