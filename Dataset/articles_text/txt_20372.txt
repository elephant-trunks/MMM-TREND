Along with this , all possible help was also provided to the officers who came from Delhi to study the ‘ Kerala Model ‘ last month. We would like to know which ‘ officers ‘ the AAP MLA has welcomed . ,

Kerala’s Dept of Education has not sent anyone to learn about the ‘Delhi Model’. At the same time, all assistance was provided to officials who had visited from Delhi to study the ‘Kerala Model’ last month. We would like to know which ‘officials’ were welcomed by the AAP MLA. https://t.co/Lgh6nM7yL9 — V. Sivankutty (@VSivankuttyCPIM) April 24, 2022
