A Facebook page called Karma News had posted a news video on Facebook claiming that the Andhra CM Jagan Mohan Reddy has appointed a Christian as the chairperson of the board of the world’s richest temple. The video claims that Jagan Mohan Reddy who is a Christian himself has appointed his Christian uncle Y.V. Subba Reddy as the chairperson of Tirumala Tirupati Devsthanam board. This post has garnered almost 300 shares in a time span of 3 hours. The presenter in the video adds that most of the members of Jagan’s family are Christian, including his father, former CM, late Y.S. Rajashekara Reddy. The video claims that Y.S. Rajashekara Reddy had tried to usurp the administration of the Hindu temple and his son and current chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, Jagan Mohan Reddy, are doing the same. The video leaves a trail of questions behind such as, “Has Andhra government appointed a Christian as the head of one of the most wealthiest Hindu temple?”, “Is Y.V. Subba Reddy a Christian?”, we will find answers to these question through investigation.

In the interview, Y.V. Subba Reddy says that, “I am born a Hindu and I will die a Hindu. These allegations and smear campaign hurt me deeply. Every year I visit Sabarimala and in every few months, I visit Shirdi. Tell those who are spreading this to visit my residences in Hyderabad or Ongole. Let they see what kind of rituals we do. There is no merit to these baseless rumors.” After saying this he pulled out a locket of Shri Venkateshwara and showed it on camera.

6.He said further, “ Jagan put in a request asking if I could serve as TTD Chairman for some days and later go to the Rajya Sabha as the elections were still some time away. I take this responsibility as my fortune. I am very fortunate to serve Sri Venkateswara and to ensure that all devotees who visit the holy shrine are able to get their ‘darshan’ smoothly.”
