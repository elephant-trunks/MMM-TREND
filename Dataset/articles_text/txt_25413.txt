Spread the truth:

An infant twitter handle with hardly 4000 followers gets 1410 Retweets and why you may ask ?

This is part of years old plan of misuse of Social Media for political gains.

Does your common sense (rare now) says –

1. Saif Ali Khan’s daughter Sara Ali Khan just after creating a twitter handle will tweet only political stuff, that too against a political party ?

2. Suddenly 4000 people will have a dream about this handle and follow it within hours ?

3. Fresh, less number of followers and just one tweet gets 1410 Retweets ? What could be the reason ? You can find out by just a glance at the other games who retweeted. I.e. some of 1410 handles.

Dont let your common sense fail you. Cherish it, save it.

Soniya Maino after marrying Rajiv Gandhi became Soniya "GANDHI" but #MeiraKumar who married a BRAHMIN remains DALIT? 😔 — Sara Ali Khan (@SaraKhanWorld) June 22, 2017
