Fact Check

Pakistan has been constantly blocking India’s bid of getting a permanent seat in the UNSC. And, Pakistan has been a constant hurdle in India’s diplomatic effort for a permanent seat in the UN security council. There was recent speculation that Paki might support India for UNSC permanent membership. But, we got a tweet of 10th July, 2022 from the verified account of @ForeignOfficePk Slamming all these rumours. In the tweet it was mentioned that, Spokesperson @Asimiahmad on rumors alluding to Pakistan’s position on Indian bid for permanent UNSC membership. “Let me tell you this is totally baseless absolute fiction. We categorically reject any such statement that is being wrongly attributed to FM @BBhuttoZardari”

Further, to check the veracity of the viral claim that India is offering an economic package to our neighbour, we did simple keyword search on google. But, the DFRAC team has not found any such information from any credible source. Moreover, we checked the official website of theManohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses(IDSA). But, there is no such news available on the website.

Further, our team also found that most of users spreading this fake news are from Pakistan and PTI supporters.

Conclusion

Therefore, the viral is without any base. As of now, there is no such credible information that India is offering Pakistan an economic package of 5 billion USD. And, in exchange, India wants to support its permanent membership at UNSC.”
