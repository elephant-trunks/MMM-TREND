Thick smog has virtually converted the Capital into a gas chamber. With citizens finding it difficult to breathe, politicians have indulged in blame game. Amid this, a picture of Delhi BJP chief and Lok Sabha MP Manoj Tiwari bursting firecrackers is going viral on social media.

The claim along with the picture says that instead of sympathising with the current situation in Delhi, Tiwari is happily bursting firecrackers. A tweet by the BJP leader in Hindi is also attached with the picture, which in English means, My eyes are burning in Delhi today. And yours?
