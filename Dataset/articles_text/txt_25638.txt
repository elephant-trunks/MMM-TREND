A video in which a portion of the road appears to have collapsed is being widely shared on social media with a claim that these are the visuals of the recently inaugurated Bundelkhand Expressway in Uttar Pradesh.

The video is being shared on Facebook with the caption, “पहली बरसात में ही बुंदेलखंड एक्सप्रेस-वे के हालात. लगता है ड्रोन की बैटरी ख़राब है”

(English translation: Condition of Bundelkhand Expressway in the first rain itself. Looks like the drone’s battery is bad)

Here’s the link to the above post.

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim and found it to be MISLEADING.

Using the InVid Tool, we extracted keyframes from the viral video and performed a Reverse Image Search. This search directed us to a similar video uploaded on the YouTube channel of the Economic Times on July 25, 2022. The video caption reads, “Madhya Pradesh: Road caves in Bhopal due to heavy rainfall in the city.”

Taking a cue from this, we searched further and found many other credible news articles that reported the same incident carrying similar visuals. According to these articles, A portion of the approach road to a bridge on the Kaliasot river in Madhya Pradesh’s Raisen district caved in early this morning near the Mandideep area – less than 25 km from the capital Bhopal, in less than a year of construction. The cave-in did not cause any injuries or casualties.”

However, it is true that a part of Bundelkhand Expressway “caved in after rain yesterday, within a week of its inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 16.” Check similar reports here and here.

Thus, it is evident from the above information that visuals of a damaged road in Madhya Pradesh are being falsely linked to the Bundelkhand Expressway in Uttar Pradesh.
