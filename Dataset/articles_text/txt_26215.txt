A video of people reciting Azaan is going viral on the internet. Further, by sharing the video people are claiming that these people have found an alternative to the loudspeakers. Along with the video, @IAbhay_Pratap wrote a caption that can be nearly translated into English, “Has Azaan option been found on loudspeaker? This video is clarifying this mentality that if you have courage then stop… But if this thinking is not stopped, then the subject will not be limited to Ajan alone, it is important to understand this.”
