A video of Rahul Gandhi has been doing rounds on social media in which, he can be heard saying, “Not only in Hindustan, the Indian youth can bring change to the entire nation.”

Several social media users shared the video, mocking Rahul Gandhi.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the viral video was clipped. In the original video, the Congress leader corrected himself within moments of this faux pas.

AFWA PROBE

While investigating the claim, we first noticed that the podium in front of Gandhi mentioned the words “Yuva Aakrosh Rally” and the date “January 28”.

Taking this as a cue, we conducted a keyword search and found the original video uploaded to YouTube on January 28, 2020. Caption with this video reads, “Shri Rahul Gandhi addresses Yuva Aakrosh Rally in Jaipur, Rajasthan.”

At the 2:35 minutes mark in this video Rahul Gandhi could be seen making the statement given in the viral video.

In the original video, Gandhi first stated, “Not only in Hindustan, but the Indian youth can also bring change to the entire nation.” However, he immediately corrected himself and said, “Not only in India, but the Indian youth can also bring changes to the whole world.”

Hence, we can conclude that the claim with this video is misleading. The viral video is a clipped version of the original video. In the original video, Gandhi corrected his mistake immediately after saying it.
