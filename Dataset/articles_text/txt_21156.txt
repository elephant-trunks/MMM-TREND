As the Russian invasion of Ukraine entered its second week, a video was circulated on social media with claims that it captured missile attacks in Ukraine.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the claim along with the video was misleading. This video was a compilation of clips from two different incidents, one in South Korea, and the other in Afghanistan.
