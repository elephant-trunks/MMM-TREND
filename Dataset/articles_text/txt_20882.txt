In the last 5 days or so, a newspaper clipping of Jansatta has been going viral on Facebook and Twitter. The newspaper clipping shows a picture of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan along with a little bit of text which says that he credits of his success and fame to his Muslim brothers and that this brotherhood is what makes their religion unique.

Fact-Check:

Upon reverse searching the image, we found nothing of this sort on Jansatta’s website or any other platforms. We did however end up finding a clarification on the issue from Jansatta themselves. They clarified that they have never done such a story and that no such news has been revealed.

Since no such statement was issued by Jansatta, this claim is fake.
