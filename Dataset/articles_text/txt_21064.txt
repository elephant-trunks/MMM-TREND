An explosion on April 13 damaged the Russian guided-missile cruiser Moskva. The day after, Russian state media confirmed the Soviet-era warship sank amidst efforts to tow it to the closest port. While Moscow maintained it was a fire near the warship's ammunition that caused the explosion, Ukraine claimed its Neptune missiles were responsible.

Following this, pro-Kyiv social media accounts shared a video of an exploding ship, claiming it was footage of Moskva’s demise.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the claim was false. The video captured a Norwegian missile test-fire in 2013 — unrelated to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.

The clip showed the exploding vessel from some distance, making it difficult to compare it to images of the Moskva.

According to media reports, the warship exploded on Wednesday night.The video in circulation, however, was shot during the daytime.

A reverse search of the keyframes of the video took us to YouTube. Uploaded to South West News Service's channel on June 6, 2013, the video was titled "Norwegian Navy Test Missile Strike."

"The Norwegian armed forces took a decommissioned frigate out into the sea for a game of target practice. They then fired the new 'Joint Strike Missile' at the vessel with pinpoint accuracy, causing a huge explosion and major damage to the vessel," the video's description read.

The video showed the test-fire from two different angles. Forty seconds into the video, we saw a long-range shot of the missile strike — the part that we saw in the viral video.

We found the footage on CNN's YouTube channel as well.

According to reports, Norway used a decommissioned frigate as cannon fodder for its new subsonic missile in June 2013. The location of the test-fire was off the coast of Andoy in Norway.

Thus, we concluded the footage of the exploding ship did not show the Moskva. It was a Norwegian test-fire from 2013.
