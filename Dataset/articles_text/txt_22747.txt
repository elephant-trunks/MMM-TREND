The fact

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is from Lahore, not Ludhiana.

The video, which was uploaded on July 11, has already been shared at least 700 times.

The video is also being circulated on YouTube and Twitter with the false claim.

The probe

Upon reverse-searching one of the frames of the video, we found an Instagram post of leading Pakistani media house Dawn News related to the incident. As per Dawn News, the video of the robbery incident is from Lahore.

We also found a video of YouTube channel City42 describing the same incident. According to City42, the incident happened in the Nawab town area of Lahore. The video was uploaded on June 26, 2019.

Alt News had also debunked this misleading news.

The conclusion

Stitching the facts together, AFWA established that the robbery incident in the video didn’t take place in India.

The video, which has been viral for the last two weeks, was earlier circulated with the claim that it is from Rajpura town of Patiala.
