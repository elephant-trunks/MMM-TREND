Fact Check:

On examining the above claim, our team received a tweet from Sonu Sood. In which he congratulated his sister Malvika on joining the Congress.

As my sister Malvika Sood embarks on her political journey, I wish her the best and can’t wait to see her flourish in this new chapter of her life. Good luck Malvika! My own work as an actor & humanitarian continues, without any political affiliations or distractions. pic.twitter.com/NCI0d4nUgC — sonu sood (@SonuSood) January 10, 2022
