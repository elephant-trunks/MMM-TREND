As the cyclone Nivar hit along the Tamil Nadu-Puducherry coast, social media is abuzz with videos of its drastic visuals. One such video of a heavy cloudburst into the sea is being shared as the arrival of cyclone Nivar.

Fact Crescendo has received this video on our WhatsApp Factline (9049053770) for a fact-check. We found that the viral video is, in fact, not of a real storm. It is just a CGI simulation of a tornado.

WHAT’S THE CLAIM?

Original Video – Facebook | Archive

A 13-second clip shared on Facebook and Twitter shows dramatic visuals of cloud bursting into the sea against the backdrop of the setting sun. The caption given to this video reads: Human life is gonna end soon. One after another, bad things happening to humans. Advance RIP humans. #ChennaiRain #ChennaiFloods #CycloneNivar #CycloneNivarUpdate #Chennaiweather

Assuming the descent of the Ganga must have been as forceful, if not more!



This is the arrival of #CycloneNivar!



Stay safe, everyone!

CONCLUSION

Thus, we can conclude that the viral video is not of cyclone Nivar. It is an old and computer-generated video that is being peddled as being of a real storm.
