A controversy erupted recently, when the opposition claimed that Zoish Irani, daughter of Union Minister Smriti Irani, owns a bar named Silly Soul Cafe in Goa. However, she has refuted the claim.

In the above context, an image of a menu purportedly of the bar owned by Smriti Irani’s daughter has gone viral on social media.

The image is shared with a caption, claiming that Smriti Irani’s daughter sells pork and beef at her restaurant.

A social media user shared the image of the menu with a caption: “Menu card of Zoish Irani, daughter of Smriti Irani’s restaurant..! Beef served..!”

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did the fact check, and found it to be fake.

On doing a Google Reverse Image Search, we found the same menu uploaded by Upper Deck, Radisson Blue Resort, on Zomato. It can be noticed that the item just below the beef tongue mentions: ‘Our signature — Half rack barbecue baby-back ribs,’ which is same as the menu mentioned in the viral image.

The same menu is mentioned on EazyDinner, confirming that it belongs to Upper Deck, Radisson Blue Resort.

Also, the menu of Silly Souls Bar & Restaurant on Zomato does not mention about beef or pork.

While searching on Google with ‘SFO Beef Tongue’, we found that Just Dial had mentioned the name of the dish in the Upper Deck menu.

Hence, we can ascertain that the viral claim is fake.
