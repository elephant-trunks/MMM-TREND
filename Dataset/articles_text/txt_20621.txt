A picture of the news plate of INDIA TV is going viral on social media platforms. The picture contains a pic of PM Modi with “Me jato k ghar se lassi mang kar lata tha” meaning “I used to bring lassi from the jats” written on the breaking plate.” Furthermore, I lived in Jatland for 20 years.” Meanwhile, sharing the picture users wrote in the caption which can be nearly translated into English, “He remembered the lassi when the Jats made him learn a good lesson.”
