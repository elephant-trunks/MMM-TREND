A video is getting viral on social media of Arvind Kejriwal, CM of Delhi. In the video he is sounding in anger against Gujrat and its population.

People all over the internet are posting the video under the caption, “Why Kejriwal ji hates Gujarat so much. (Translates Hindi)

Fact Check:

By only looking at the video we can predict that the video is morphed part of the whole speech presented by Kejriwal.

We at DFRAC reverse searched the image and found the same video on the official YouTube channel of Aam Admi Party.

The section of the speech starts from 14:43 minutes where Kejriwal was targeting Amit Shah.

The difference between both the videos was also posted by the official page of AAP.

See this @BJP4Gujarat low-level work of Surat MLA @sanghaviharsh ji – Seeing the increasing popularity of the Aam Aadmi Party in Gujarat, they are misleading the public by sharing such fake videos. Reads the caption. (Translates Hindi)

The video is also 5 years old, hence misleading in nature.
