Between 2015 and 2020, India’s total fertility or, the number of live births per woman, would be 2.3 births, a number which is set to reduce to 2.1 by 2030, and 1.7 by 2050, according to projections by the United Nations department of economic and social affairs. This suggests that the rate of increase in population in India will reduce.

In comparison, between 2015 and 2020 Chinese women would have given, on average, 1.63 births each, which will increase to 1.8 by 2050.

Overall, total fertility or the number of live births per woman is set to converge across countries in South Asia to an average of 1.78 births per woman.
