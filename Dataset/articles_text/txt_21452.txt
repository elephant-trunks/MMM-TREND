It is being claimed on social media that upset over the Lakhimpur violence, Gandhi has removed “BJP” from his Twitter bio, an indication that he may soon quit the party. Some netizens even speculated that he might join the Congress.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the viral claim to be untrue. Gandhi’s Twitter bio did not have the word “BJP” for the last seven years. The last time it was seen was way back in October 2014.
