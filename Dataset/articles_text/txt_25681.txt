A video is viral on social media, showing a group of students reciting Azaan during an assembly. The video is shared with a caption claiming that it is of Jharkhand where Muslims are in majority, and students are being forced to recite Azaan.

The caption of the video reads: “झारखंड के 75% मुस्लिम आबादी के गांव की स्कूल में दबाव बढ़ाकर हिंदू छात्रों को भी अल्लाह की इबादत को मज़बूर किया – तालिबानी इस्लामिक राज्य आ रहा है ?????” (English translation: The school of a village having a 75% Muslim population in Jharkhand forced Hindu students to worship Allah — Taliban Islamic State is coming?)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did the fact-check, and found it to be misleading.

On searching with appropriate keywords on Google, we found the same video uploaded by a hyperlocal news channel, News & Only News, on June 4, 2022. It was shared with a title: “Morning Azaan practice at Gyan Vikas primary school in Mariani, Assam”

We also found the same news, reported by News 18 Assam on June 6, 2022, suggesting that the incident was from Assam, where a student recited Azaan during Gunotsav. The article further said that Assam Education Department had issued a show-cause notice to the headmaster of the school for explanation on the incident.

Hence, we can ascertain that the viral video is from Assam, and not Jharkhand.
