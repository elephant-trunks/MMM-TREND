Lakhs of people have been adversely impacted by the ongoing floods in Assam. Amid this, a shocking video made the rounds on social media that showed a family getting washed away along with a bridge that collapsed over an overflowing river. Those sharing the video claimed it was from Assam.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the video was neither recent nor from Assam. It was from the 2017 floods in Bihar.

A reverse search of the keyframes of the video in question led us to multiple news reports from 2017. The video was uploaded by ANI on its YouTube channel on August 18, 2017. According to the description, the video was from the Araria district of Bihar.

The description said, “A shocking incident, in which three people were feared drowned after a bridge connecting a village collapsed, was recorded on camera in Bihar’s Araria district.”

We also found a longer version of the video in an India Today report from 2017. In this video, several people could be seen crossing the bridge before it collapsed into the overflowing river.

Per the report, the video showed two children and an adult from a family trying to cross a bridge in Araria. All the three were washed away with the bridge.

In a video report about the incident published by The Quint, the sister of the woman seen falling in the video and the man who shot it spoke about the incident. The family member confirmed the death of all three.

The incident happened during flash floods in Bihar. By August 17, 2017, around 100 people had lost their lives in the state, and nearly 93 lakh people from 15 districts were affected by the floods.

It is thus clear that the video is around five years old and not related to the ongoing Assam floods.
