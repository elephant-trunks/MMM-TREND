So far, more than 70 Omicron cases have been reported in India. Even the World Health Organization has expressed concern over the alarming rate at which this variant is spreading across the world.

In the backdrop of these developments, some netizens are claiming that scientists at pharma company Pfizer have warned that weekly vaccinations are required to prevent an Omicron-induced lockdown.

An alleged news screenshot is being shared as evidence of the claim. The headline of this said article reads, “Pfizer Scientists Warn Weekly Vaccinations May Be Needed For Omicron Variant COVID-19 To Prevent Lockdown”.

The archived version of the post can be seen here.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral screenshot is from a satire website. It’s not an actual news report. Pfizer has not made any such announcement about a weekly vaccination for Omicron.

Using keyword search, we found that the source of the viral screenshot is an article published on a website named “The Stonk Market”. The website calls itself satire and says its mission is to provide a daily dose of humour.

Keanna Ghazvini, a representative for Pfizer, has confirmed to Reuters that Pfizer has not issued such a statement.

Scientists around the world are working on ways to deal with rising cases of Omicron, but evidently, an article published on a satire website is being falsely shared as a genuine news report by some netizens.
