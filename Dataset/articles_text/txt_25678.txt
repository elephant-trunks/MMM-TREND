A graphic is extensively circulated on social media claiming that BJP National spokesperson Sambit Patra said only the gas price has increased, not the cylinder.

The text on the graphic reads: “सिर्फ़ गैस महंगा हुआ है सिलेंडर नहीं: संदीप पात्रा’. महंगाई के मुद्दों पर जमकर बोले संदीप पात्रा, विपक्ष को घेरा” (English translation: Only gas has become expensive, not cylinders: Sandeep Patra. Sandeep Patra spoke fiercely on issues of inflation, and surrounded the Opposition.)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the post, and found it to be false.

It should be noted that even though the graphic has a picture of BJP National spokesperson Sambit Patra, the text reads ‘Sandeep Patra’.

We ran a keyword search but did not find any media report corroborating the viral claim. We then ran a Reverse Image Search on the picture in the graphic and found that the same image had been used by multiple media organisations as a file image in 2020 and 2021. The reports can be seen here, here and here.

Earlier, NewsMobile debunked several fact checks where the same graphic format has been used. They can be read here and here.

Going through previous fact checks, we discovered that the template was available on a website — Break Your Own News, which was used to produce the above graphic.

Hence, based on the above fact check, we can say that the post in circulation is false.
