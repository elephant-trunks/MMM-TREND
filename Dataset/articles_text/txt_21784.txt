A short clip of a person sitting inside a vehicle and distributing alcohol is circulating on social media with the claim that this is a scene from the ongoing farmers’ protests. The video shows a group of young and old men holding glasses and bowls from outside as the person in the vehicle pours liquor on them.

The 31-second video is being shared with the caption, “Farmers protests. Free liquor distribution.”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading. The video is available on the Internet at least since April last year, while the three farm laws against which farmers are protesting were passed by the Centre in September 2020.

AFWA probe

We did a reverse image search of keyframes of the video and found that it was up on the Internet months before the passing of the three farm laws. Many Facebook users had shared the video in April 2020.

However, the central government passed the three farm Bills only in September 2020 during the monsoon session of Parliament. Introduced as ordinances in June 2020, they were passed in both Houses of Parliament amid ruckus by Opposition members. The President gave his assent on September 27, 2020.

The laws led to agitation by some farmers’ groups who alleged that they will be left at the mercy of corporates. Punjab witnessed protests for weeks, and late November onwards, farmers’ unions gheraoed Delhi.

Hence, it is clear that the video in circulation showing the distribution of alcohol is not related to the ongoing farmers’ protests in India.
