Photos of a woman crying with a child and men carrying burnt copies of the Quran are being circulated with the claim that they are from recent unrest in Tripura.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room has found that the claim along with the images is misleading.

While the first photo is of a Rohingya Muslim woman detained by the Border Security Force (BSF) at the India-Bangladesh border, the second is from a blaze at a Rohingya refugee camp at Kanchan Kunj in Delhi.
