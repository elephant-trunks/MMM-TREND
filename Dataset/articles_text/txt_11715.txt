We looked through Sinha's social media handles and news reports to see how has he reacted to Sharma's statement and the controversy that ensued.

After the party suspended Nupur Sharma on 5 June, Sinha took to Twitter to call the former BJP spokesperson a "fringe element" while also accussing the centre about the same.

Sinha also expressed his views on Twitter about BJP not directly acknowledging Sharma's remarks. He took a dig at PM Modi by questioning whether he is supporting such statements.
