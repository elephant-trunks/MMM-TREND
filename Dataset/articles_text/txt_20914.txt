On September 21,2021, a hashtag named “#हर_डकैत_मोदी_से_परेशान” was trending on Twitter. Within this hashtag many users posted an image of men carrying what looks to be driftwood with each cart having a BJP flag.

Many posted the image along with the caption,”Farmers stand rock solid with Modi ji”.

Fact-Check:

Upon reverse searching the key frames of the video, we found that the picture was posted at least as early as December,2020. The farmers’ protest was not even fully active by then.

We found that a twitter user had posted the image in 2020.

Since the image is definitely older than the claim, we can say that this claim is misleading.
