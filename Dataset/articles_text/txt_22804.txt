Even as news channels and websites are busy updating people on the status of Cyclone Vayu, social media is flooded with images of its 'impact'.

A Facebook page called 'Mumbai' posted a picture claiming that it is a photo of the cyclone in Mumbai.

India Today's Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the photo is an old one.

On June 13, Facebook page 'Mumbai' posted a photo which shows dark clouds above a seaside road. The message with the photo reads, "Cyclone Vayu hits coasts of Mumbai. Dangerous situation all over the city Stay Alert."

Many Facebook users have shared the photo. The archived version of the post can be seen here.

AFWA did a reverse search of the photo and found that it is an old one. We located the photo on Shutterstock.com. Tushar Kharabe, whose Shutterstock ID is 1143454223, had uploaded the photo on the website on November 16, 2018.

The photo caption reads, "Indian mansson (monsoon) environment", but he didn't mention the location where it was clicked. The photo had been shared multiple times by different users on various online platforms. It is clear from the photo that the location is Marine Drive in Mumbai.
