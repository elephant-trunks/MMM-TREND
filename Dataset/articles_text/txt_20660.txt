Yogi Ji determined on the development in ‘Har Ghar Nal Yojna’, the scheme was introduced by PM Narendra Modi on November 2020, this scheme comes under Jal Jeevan Mission, launched in two districts of Uttar Pradesh Mirzapur and Sonbhadra. Yogi Ji claimed that under the surveillance of Har Ghar Nal Yojna, pure water is supplied to 30k Gram Panchayat villages.

Fact Check

The spin in the story comes here if you have noticed the scheme is only prevailed in 2 districts of UP Mirzapur has 1971 villages and Sonbhadra has 1450 villages which make a lump sum of 3500 villages. Then how come this scheme has served the people of 30k villages.

Another proof where Police Result posted about Har Ghar Nal Yojna, as you can see the article was posted on 29th December 2021. They have specifically mentioned that the scheme has been launched in only two districts of Uttar Pradesh, Mirzapur and Sonbhadra.

Conclusion- Serving 30k villages is a fake and misleading Tweet by UP CM Yogi Adityanath.
