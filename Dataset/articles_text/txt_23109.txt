Rumour-mongers communalising crime, beware! India Today Fact Check has exposed attempts to fuel communal hatred by linking Muslims with incidents of rape.

A co-founder of right-wing propaganda portal Postcard News, Mahesh Hegde made a sensationalist claim on Twitter on July 3.

He came out with data that suggested most rapes were committed by Muslims.

Hegde, who had been earlier arrested in Karnataka for spreading fake news, issued some figures on his Twitter handle.

Rape victims are Hindus ???? Som Tiwari (@VoiceOfSomu) June 30, 2018

Hegde cited no official source for the figures he circulated. "I have the data backing this message but I am not sharing it with anybody at this point of time," he told India Today when asked about the source.

But our fact check busted his claims.

The Fact Check team examined the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) and found it had published no data beyond 2016.

We next checked the NCRB thoroughly to look for any religion-based statistics. But none segregated criminal cases community-wise.

The NCRB categorises rape data based on the victims' age and caste if SC/ST and offenders' relation with the victims.

India Today debunked the malicious attempts to give a communal colour to sexual assaults.
