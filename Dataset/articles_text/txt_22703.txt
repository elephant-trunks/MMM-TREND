Heavy rains have wreaked havoc in various parts of India, including Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Amid this, a video is going viral on social media showing a massive mudslide with trees sliding down a mountain.

It is being claimed that the video is from Arakot village of Uttar Kashi district in Uttarakhand. In the video, people can be seen running in panic.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is not from India. The mudslide took place in Bolivia in February this year. The archived version of the post can be seen here.



The video with the misleading claim is being widely shared on Facebook.



With the help of InVID tool, we reverse searched one of the keyframes of the video and found many news reports in which the viral video was used. As per a report by The Guardian, the disaster took place in February this year due to heavy rains in a mountainous area north-east of Bolivia's capital Sucre.

The report says there was no immediate report of casualties in this incident, but a day earlier, another mudslide buried vehicles in the same area, killing at least 11 people.



We also found a YouTube video of news agency Associated Press describing the same incident.







Some netizens in the comment section also pointed out that the video is old and not from India.



But though this particular incident is not from India, the situation here due to rains is no better either. A recent report by The Times of India says at least 31 people were killed due to heavy rains in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
