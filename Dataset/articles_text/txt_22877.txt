An unusual video clip of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is spreading like wildfire on social media. It seems in the video that the PM is calling himself the son of a Pathan while addressing a rally. Modi can be heard saying, "Main Pathan ka bachcha hu, main sachcha bolta hu, sachcha karta hu (I am the son of a Pathan. I speak the truth and act accordingly)."

The video is being shared widely on Facebook and Twitter. It has been shared in thousands at the time of writing this story.

India Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is misleading. A part of the speech is being spread without context.

With the help of some keywords, we found that the viral video is from a rally Modi held in Rajasthan's Tonk district in February this year. In the rally, Modi was actually telling the crowd about his conversation with Pakistan PM Imran Khan.

Modi told the public that he wished Imran on phone when he was chosen the Prime Minister of Pakistan. During this conversation, Modi asked Imran to come together and fight poverty, illiteracy and impiety in both countries.

In reply, Imran told Modi that he is the son of a Pathan, he speaks the truth and acts accordingly. ("Modi ji, main Pathan ka bachcha hu, main sachcha bolta hu, sachcha karta hu").

It is clearly understood from the original video that Modi actually attributed the 'Pathan's son' statement to Imran. Someone mischievously tailored and shared only a portion of the speech.
