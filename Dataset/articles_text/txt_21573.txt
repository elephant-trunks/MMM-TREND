Muslims around the world observed Eid al-Adha, also known as “feast of the sacrifice”, on July 21.

Soon after, an image of a street filled with bloody water started circulating on social media with the claim that it shows a post-Bakrid scene in India.

The archived versions of the posts can be seen here and here.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the image to be misleading. This is a 2016 image from Dhaka in Bangladesh.

With the help of keyword search, we found the same image along with other similar pictures, in several news reports from 2016.

According to these reports, the visuals are from Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka.

According to a BBC report published on September 14, 2016, the picture shows blood from animals sacrificed for Eid al-Adha mixed with floodwater.

Referring to an article by BBC Bangla, the report said in 2016, nearly 100,000 livestock were sacrificed in Dhaka on Eid al-Adha on streets and underground car parks in residential societies. Meanwhile, the city that has a poor drainage system also witnessed heavy rainfall on the same day, and this resulted in blood and animal waste getting mixed with floodwater.

According to a report by “The Guardian”, while authorities in Dhaka claimed they had prepared hundreds of designated sacrifice spots in the run-up to the festival, most residents preferred to make sacrifices in their garages or on streets outside their homes.

A video report on the incident by Boom can be seen below.

We could not find any similar visual from India recently. Hence, it is clear that the viral image is five years old and not from India.
