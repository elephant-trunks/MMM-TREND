Panjshir province in Afghanistan has become a symbol of resistance against the Taliban. It is the only province in the country that has remained out of bounds for the dreaded militia so far. Reports say resistance forces have inflicted heavy casualties on the Taliban as well.

Amid this, a video of heavy firing in a hilly area has gone viral on social media with the claim that this is how the National Resistance Front ambushed Taliban in Panjshir that the latter has been trying to capture. “Panjshir Resistance Ambush Taliban September 1, 2021,” reads one such caption.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is at least seven years old and not related to the ongoing clashes between Taliban and Panjshir resistance forces.

Reverse-searching the viral video, we found it in a December 2014 report on a website called “Military.com”. Here, the video description says, “Iranian soldiers ambush ISIS terrorists who were attempting to enter Iranian borders at an undisclosed location.”

However, many on social media are also claiming that the video is from Yemen. While one user had shared the video in July 2015, Arab news channel “Al Hadath” posted the video four years later, saying these are visuals of the army targeting militia forces in Yemen.

We could not independently verify the exact location and time of the firefight. However, it is certain that the video is old and not linked to the ongoing clashes between Taliban and resistance forces in Panjshir.
