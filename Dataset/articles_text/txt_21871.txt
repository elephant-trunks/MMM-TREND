With Christmas approaching, a picture has gone viral on social media showing a long path lit up with colourful lights in such a way that it resembles a Christmas tree. The claim with the photo says it is the runway of Dubai airport.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The picture is an artistic visualisation created for Ireland’s Shannon Airport as part of a Christmas advertising campaign.

While sharing the picture, social media users captioned it as “Dubai Airport runway decorated with Christmas tree”. The misleading post is viral on Facebook. The archived version can be seen here.

With the help of reverse search, we found that the same picture was tweeted by the official handle of Shannon Airport on December 15. Here, the caption with the photo reads, “Shannon Airport launches festive campaign...”



The tweet also has a link of an article, published on the website of Shannon Airport. The article says that the airport has come up with an advertising campaign ahead of Christmas in which the runway has been reimagined as a Christmas tree. It is also clearly mentioned in the article that the runway image is an artistic visualisation for the campaign.

The spokesperson of Shannon Group commented on the initiative that “after a tough year for people in Ireland, we wanted to welcome Santa as he prepares to fly over Shannon Airport”.

Therefore, it can be said that the claim with the picture is false. The picture just shows a visualisation that has nothing to do with Dubai airport.
