A video of a man influencing voters inside a polling booth has gone viral with the claim that this is from the recently concluded Bihar elections.

In the video, a man can be seen walking into the polling compartment thrice as voters enter to cast their votes. Several Facebook users have posted the video with a caption in Hindi which translates to, “This is how BJP won the elections in Bihar. Look at the man sitting on the bench.”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is from the 2019 Lok Sabha elections where a polling agent at Asaoti in Faridabad, Haryana, was caught on video casting votes illegally. He was later arrested.

Tracing the viral video

Using InVID and reverse image search, we found several media reports regarding the video.

According to these reports, published in May 2019, the incident took place during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections at Prithla in Asaoti under Faridabad Parliamentary seat. We also found an NDTV clip on YouTube with the same video.

On May 12, 2019, the District Election Office of Faridabad confirmed through Twitter that the person was arrested.

Hence, it is confirmed that linking the viral video to the recent Bihar elections is misleading. The viral video of a polling agent influencing voters is from the Lok Sabha elections last year. The incident took place at Asaoti in Faridabad.
