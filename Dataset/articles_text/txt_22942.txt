Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's dressing sense has always been a talking point be it his muffler or sandal. But the latest one doing rounds on social media is just unbelievable.

A Facebook user -- Banty Kashyap -- has shared a photo which shows Kejriwal wearing a midi-length shirt at a function.

India Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this claim to be totally false.

The Hindi translation of the message attached with the photograph reads, "New fashion. Who wears such long shirts brother?"

Many people have replied on the post, making fun of the CM.

Here is the visualisation of the original and the photoshopped photo.
