Using reverse image search, we found that the picture was taken during the Jat agitation in Haryana almost four years back. The picture was carried in a report by “Hindustan Times”, dated February 6, 2017.

The caption of the image reads, “Jat women protesters on way to Jassia village during their agitation for reservation in Rohtak.” According to the report, the Jat community was demanding quota in government jobs and education.

The same picture was also carried by “Outlook”.

It is true that many women have joined their male counterparts at the ongoing farmers’ agitation near Delhi against the new farm laws. But the viral picture is almost four years old and it shows Jat reservation protesters in Haryana.
