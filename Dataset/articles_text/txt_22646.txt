To verify the claim, we listened carefully to the viral video and found some important clues. First of all, the uniform of the cop resembles that of Pakistan police. One can see the similarities in the comparison below.

At 40 seconds into the video, the policeman appeals to collect the kid from "Khawaja Ajmer Nagri" police station. A Google search showed that the said police station is in Karachi, Pakistan. The policeman also confirms that the kid is so young that she can't speak or say her name.

We also found the same video on YouTube which was uploaded on December 4, 2018. This means that the video is quite old.

Therefore, it is clear that the viral video is not from Nagpur but Pakistan.
