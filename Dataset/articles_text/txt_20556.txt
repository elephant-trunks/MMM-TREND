Fact check

After reading the claims we researched further and got to know the entire violence erupted between cow vigilantes and cattle transporters. Rachakonda Police released a press note which states the detail of the case. According to the note, illegal transportation of the cattle created communal tension in Telangana.

In the whole report, there have been no mentions of the Muslim mob attacking cow vigilantes or anyone in the Karmanghat Hanuman Temple from 22 February to 23 February. The Hindu also covered the news of the clash between cow Vigilantes and cattle transporters in Hyderabad.

Conclusion: No Muslim mob has attacked in Karmanghat Hanuman Temple, Therefore the claim is fake and misleading.
