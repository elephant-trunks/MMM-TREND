On May 12, just hours before Narendra Modi’s address to the nation, a video began circulating on social media showing the Prime Minister in a make-up session along with international experts.

The claim along with the video says this was how PM Modi was preparing for the 8 pm speech. The 40-second video was shared with a caption in Hindi that translates to, “Preparation for 8 pm tonight.”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room has found that the video is four years old. The video was shot in 2016 when PM Modi met Madame Tussauds artistes at his New Delhi residence. Madame Tussauds is a famous museum chain known for lifelike wax statues of famous personalities.

AFWA investigation

In 2016, PM Modi joined the list of powerful world leaders to have a wax figure at the four major Madame Tussauds museums in London, Singapore, Hong Kong and Bangkok. This was widely reported at that time by all mainstream media.

A team of artistes from Madame Tussauds had arrived at Modi’s residence months before to collect details of his physical attributes, including his eye color, hair texture and skin complexion, so as to meticulously replicate his wax statue.

The entire process was recorded and shot by the Madame Tussauds team. On March 16, it was uploaded on YouTube with the caption, “Narendra Modi’s sitting| Madame Tussauds London”.

This particular video has been misused several times with misleading claims such as PM Modi spending lakhs of rupees on his makeup. AFWA had earlier debunked this claim.
