Amid the ongoing controversy over the 'Jai Shri Ram' slogan, a video has gone viral on social media in which some policemen can be seen beating an elderly Muslim man and others brutally with a lathi (cane).

The claim

The caption along with the video says, "Hindustan me rehna hoga, Jai Shri Ram kehna hoga." The video is being presented in such a way that it gives the impression that the incident occurred in India.

The truth

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The viral video is not from India. It is a five-year-old video from Lahore in Pakistan.

Facebook user Chakrawarti Vikramaditya uploaded the post on July 7 and it has already been shared more than 600 times. In the comment section of the video, some users pointed out that the video does not appear to be from India and could be from Pakistan or Bangladesh.

The investigation

With the help of InVID tool, we segregated the video into multiple keyframes and upon reverse searching one of them, we found another version of the video on Twitter as well as on YouTube.

The video has put out some information regarding the incident through sub-titles.

Using keywords from these sub-titles, we found the viral video in several Pakistani news videos related to the incident called Model Town massacre or Lahore massacre.

The case

The incident happened in Lahore due to a violent clash between Pakistan's Punjab Police and Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) on June 17, 2014.

As per a report published in tribune.com, eight people were killed and 97 injured in the clash.

The clash began when PAT activists tried to stop the police from removing barriers outside their leader's house in Lahore's Model Town, according to Express News.

The conclusion

Hence, the facts clearly establish that the viral video has no connection with India.
