How this viral tweet and the handle was organized ?

If you are on twitter, you must already be in know of that how difficult it is to get followers, retweets, replies even over the years you joined twitter.

But this account, with just 8 tweets, just within a month has now 6300 followers. That one tweet got 4000 retweets. What was so earth shattering about it ?

In fact just yesterday it had approx 1500 followers and now crossed 6000.

This is not the first time, people fell for impersonating accounts earlier too
