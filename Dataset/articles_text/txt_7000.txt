It was reported that 30 empty bullet shells were recovered from the crime scene where Punjabi singer and Congress leader Sidhu Moose Wala was shot dead by unidentified assailants on May 29. Several days after the murder at Jawaharke village in Mansa, the investigators are yet to zero in on the assailants.

Meanwhile, a video has gone viral on social media with the claim that it showed the ambush by the killers on Moose Wala. "Waheguru ji, see how the killers of Moose Wala attacked him," the translation of a Punjabi Facebook post that shared the video read.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The footage isn't real but clipped from an action series streaming online.
