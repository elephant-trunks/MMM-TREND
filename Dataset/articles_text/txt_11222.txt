Next, we found another tweet by the official account of Star Sports revealing the mystery behind the new look, Star Sports on 14th March launched an ad-campaign for IPL 2021 featuring Dhoni in his new look. The tweet stated that “#VIVOIPL salutes the new Indian spirit that is eager to innovate and rewrite the rulebook. Will history be created yet again this IPL? Join us in celebrating #IndiaKaApnaMantra. LIVE from Apr 9 | Broadcast starts 6 PM, Match starts 7:30 PM | Star Sports & Disney+Hotstar VIP.”

The tweet also attached the advertisement where one can see Mahendra Singh Dhoni as a guru preaching his students about IPL.
