The Maharashtra government began relaxation of lockdown measures in the state by launching Mission Begin Again. The first of the three phases began on June 3 with private offices allowed to operate with 10% staff and resumption of BEST services.

With overcrowding reported in many places, Thackeray had tweeted on June 10 that lockdown will be reimposed if "relaxations to the lockdown starts turning out to be risky." However, no decision has been taken so far on reimposing the lockdown.
