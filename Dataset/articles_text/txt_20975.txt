Uttarakhand’s Nainital has always been a cherished destination for travellers. The hill station has witnessed an episode of communal tension recently. Amid this, a collage of two images that claim to compare the current scenario in Nainital with that 12 years ago has gone viral on social media.

The collage is shared by many on Twitter and Facebook with captions like "Hindu families are brainwashed by 'hum do humare do'. This weakens the family system. Day by day, we are losing to them." Here, "them" refers to the Muslim community.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this collage to be misleading as the second image was not taken from Nainital. The photograph of Muslim public prayer is from Bangladesh.
