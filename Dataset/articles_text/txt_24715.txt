Hyderabad: With the first phase of polling set to begin tomorrow, FactChecker has launched a new portal, Constituency Check, to analyse the performance of Lok Sabha constituencies on select health, education and economic indicators.

Besides providing an overall picture, the interactive portal can also be of assistance to monitor progress in each constituency. While various surveys document the performance of villages, block, districts and states, there are no official surveys at the Lok Sabha constituency level. This is an attempt to fill this gap.

Data for the portal have been extracted from the National Family Health Survey, 2015-16 (NFHS-4), the 71st round of the National Sample Survey (2014), and the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), 2016-17.

While a Lok Sabha constituency may span multiple districts, state assembly constituencies do not. First, district-level data were matched with state assembly constituencies. Since Lok Sabha constituencies comprise several assembly segments, data derived for the latter were extrapolated to the former.

Since the sampling can vary across and within districts, these data may not match a constituency-level survey if and when conducted, but are indicative to infer where a constituency stands in comparison to the national average.

In the next phase, we will add a module to compare the constituencies’ performance with state averages.

Education indicators

1. Net enrolment ratio at upper primary level

India has been successful in increasing primary school (grades I-V) enrolment to the extent that more than 83% of primary school-age children were enrolled in 2016-17, according to data from the District Information System for Education (DISE).

We looked at the net enrolment ratio at the upper primary level (grades VI and VII) to understand if this near-universal school education enrolment is continuing through the elementary level. Net enrolment ratio (NER) is defined as the percentage of children in the corresponding age-group enrolled in upper primary school.

Tiruppur (99.9%) in Tamil Nadu, South Goa (99.2%), and Erode (96.7%) in Tamil Nadu have the highest NER in upper primary school, while Mumbai South-Central Mumbai North-West, Mumbai North-East and Mumbai North-Central (20.3%) have the lowest enrolment rate.
