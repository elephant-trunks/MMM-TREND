A video of a Sikh policeman issuing a warning on a loudspeaker has gone viral on social media.

In the 27-second-long clip, the Punjab Police officer, who was heard speaking in Hindi, asked people to remain vigilant because two cheetahs had escaped in Chandigarh.

He said in Hindi, “Two cheetahs have escaped. One of them is in Chandigarh, the other one in Mohali. Make sure children remain in the house. Everyone must remain cautious.”

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found this video was nearly two years old. It was shared widely without any context, making the announcement feel recent.

We reverse-searched keyframes from the video on Google. The results took us to a longer video news report uploaded to YouTube which carried the same clip featuring the policeman.

This video about escaped leopards seen in Chandigarh and Mohali was uploaded on April 2, 2020, which made it clear that it was not recent, rather it was about two years old.

Aaj Tak report published on March 30, 2020. That report also mentioned an escaped leopard seen in Sector 5 of Chandigarh, which created panic among the locals. When we searched for news reports from that time, we came across anpublished on March 30, 2020. That report also mentioned an escaped leopard seen in Sector 5 of Chandigarh, which created panic among the locals.

However, while going through search results, reports suggested that another leopard was seen in Mohali recently. A Jagran report from April 6 stated that search operations were underway in Mohali’s Nayagaon.

So, we can conclude that while a leopard was recently sighted in Mohali, the video claiming two cheetahs were Chandigarh and Mohali was from 2020.
