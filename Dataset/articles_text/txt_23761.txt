Roads: The major thrust of Modi’s deal is building roads across the state; the package announced has around Rs 68,500 crore ($10.7 billion) riding on highways and rural roads.

Bihar has only 4,168 km of national highway or 5% of India's total of 79,116 km at the end of 2013, according to data released by the Ministry of Transport.

Modi has promised to spend more than Rs 54,700 crore to widen national highways across the state and construction of bridges.

Of three million km of rural roads nationwide, 167,579 km are in Bihar, the state with the fifth-longest length of rural roads.

Petroleum and gas: Rs 21,476 crore--the second-largest component of Modi's package--has already been promised by his government, as this Times of India report shows.

Electricity: The third-largest component of the Bihar package --electricity--includes a 1,300-MW power plant at Buxar. The plant has been progressing since 2013, according to SJVN, the company involved.

Airports: A new airport in Patna has been in the making for some time, according to an answer in Rajya Sabha by Minister of state for civil aviation Mahesh Sharma.
