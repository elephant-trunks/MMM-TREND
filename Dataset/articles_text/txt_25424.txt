Spread the truth:

Even on first place the photo looks fake, people with common sense will notice immediately but then, there is hardly of it left anymore. #CSDS Common Sense Deficiency Syndrome is a plague now.

This is just to let people know, not to believe in it and spread it as they have been doing forever.

Now that the tweet jas 500 retwees already, it’s highly probable your aunt is gonna send this photo in your WhatsApp group like usual 😉
