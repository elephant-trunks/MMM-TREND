A video of Shashi Tharoor clapping and dancing to a Bollywood song went viral on social media recently. Many claimed this was from the three-day Congress Chintan Shivir in Udaipur, Rajasthan, earlier this month.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the video was not from Rajasthan but from Kerala. The Bollywood song was later digitally added to the video.
