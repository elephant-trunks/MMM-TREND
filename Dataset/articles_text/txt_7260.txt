A post with the screenshot of a tweet purportedly made by Nita Ambani is shared on social media. The tweet is from the Twitter handle – ‘@0Nita_ji’ and has a profile picture of Reliance Foundation Chairperson Nita Ambani. In the tweet, the Congress party is criticized for its suggestion to the government to borrow gold from the religious trusts. Also, as a counter, she suggested that the government must sell the land enclosing three graves of Nehru’s family members to improve the economic situation in the country. But FACTLY has found the Twitter handle – ‘@0Nita_ji’ to be a fan-page of Nita Ambani. When searched if Nita Ambani has an official account on Twitter, it was found that she does not have an official Twitter account. So, Nita Ambani did not tweet what is being shared and it is from a fan-page. Earlier, when screenshots of multiple tweets went viral on the name Nita Ambani, FACTLY has debunked them and those fact-checks can be read here, here and here.
