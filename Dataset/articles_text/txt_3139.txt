FACT CHECK

When NewsMobile fact-checked the video, it was found to be false.

We extracted the keyframes of the video and put them through the Reverse Image Search along with keywords. The same video was also uploaded on YouTube, dated June 23, 2022, with the title: “Heavy rain in Karachi — Motorcycles slip in Johar Mor bridge due to heavy rain – Global TV”

We ran another search and found a report on the same by Pakistan’s Geo TV, dated June 23, 2022, with a headline: “WATCH: Multiple motorcyclists fall on slippery Karachi roads amid rain”

The video was taken at a flyover on Rashid Minhas Road near Millennium Mall in Karachi, according to the report. It also mentioned that heavy downpours and dust-storm left the roads slippery, causing many motorcycle accidents.

Based on the above information, we even used Google street view to check the location, and found it to be the same.

Hence, it is now clear that the viral video is from Pakistan and not India.
