Fact Check

On our Fact check analysis, our team found that this image is fake. On doing keyword search we found no such news of any two legged camel. Meanwhile, on doing the image reverse search we found that this is not a real picture.

We found that this, the social media users are posting a morphed image of the camel. There is no camel in this world with anly two legs. It was uploaded by Dr. Abdul Raziq Kakar, who describes himself as an animal scientist on his LinkedIn profile. Further, the original photo was published in a blog post on March 23, 2012.

Hence, the claims of social media users are fake and misleading.
