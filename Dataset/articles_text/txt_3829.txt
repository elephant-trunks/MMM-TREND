UP: Crowd gathered at Ballia Railway Station in protest against #AgnipathScheme



Forces have been deployed at station since morning. A few hooligans reached there but they were stopped from damaging much; they attempted stone-pelting. Action being taken: Ballia DM Saumya Agarwal pic.twitter.com/lSmW74l6tk
