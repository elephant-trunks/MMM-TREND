BOOM found that the image is from 2019, and shows a flooded Raymond showroom from Patna's Hathwa Market. The same image was viral in 2021, when Mumbai received 90 per cent of the average rainfall of the entire season on July 21. BOOM had then run a reverse image search on the photograph and was directed to an article published on Naidunia, on September 2019, with the same photograph. According to the article, the image from Bihar shows a flooded Raymond showroom situated at Hathwa Market in Patna. News 18 Bihar shared several other photographs of submerged apparels and accessories from the store in a tweet.
