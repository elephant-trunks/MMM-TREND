Commenting on the post, many Facebook users made fun of the government, while others pointed out that the claim is not right. However, across social media, many users have posted a similar claim.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim is false and the Indian rupee is still stronger than the Bangladeshi taka. A simple Internet search reveals that 1 rupee is equal to 1.16 taka as of Monday evening. This means that the Indian rupee is 16 per cent stronger than the Bangladeshi taka. It has hovered between 1.16 and 1.20 for the past few days.
