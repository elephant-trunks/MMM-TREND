A video is going viral on the internet of Police arrested two men. Social media users are claiming that Uttar Pradesh Police have arrested these two men for making provocative statements against Nupur Sharma. Meanwhile, a Facebook user named कृष्णा मिश्र, “Yesterday #NupurSharma was threatened by #Maulana..!!Today UP #Police lifted its doli.”

(कल #नूपुर शर्मा को धमकी दिया था #मौलाना ने..!!आज यूपी #पुलिस ने इसकी डोली उठा ली)

Similarly, many other users have shared this picture on the social media with the similar claim.

Fact Check

Using InVID tool and reverse image search on different frames of the Video. We got a three minutes long video on YouTube channel ofNews24. The title of the video is. “Nupur Sharma के खिलाफ भड़काऊ भाषण देने वाला मौलाना Mufti Nadeem हुआ गिरफ्तार | Rajasthan.”

Further, we also found a tweet from the verified account of ANI MP/CG/Rajasthan in which it was written that, “Rajasthan | Bundi Police have arrested two clerics accused of giving inflammatory statements during a protest against suspended BJP leader Nupur Sharma. Further probe underway.”
