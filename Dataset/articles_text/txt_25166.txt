JK Now reported on both the incidents, on May 11, 2020, with the headline, ‘Pakistan murders Hindus yet again; 21 houses with children inside set on fire’.

The article read, “In an act of utter inhumanity, Pakistan continuing its atrocities on Hindus burnt down 21 houses belonging to Hindus in Sindh of Pakistan. Hindus including children were beaten up and forced to leave their homes, those who were still inside their burning houses are reportedly critical. In another village, the local goons of Pakistan attacked a poor Hindu family and sexually assaulted a woman from the family forcing them to leave their locality.”

Pakistani news portal, Instant also reported the news,

According to a recent report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), has said that both Hindu and Christian communities in Sindh and Punjab continue to face forced conversions and violence in Pakistan.

The report also said that the religious minorities in the country are being deprived of their right to freedom of religion, noted that the girls were abducted, forcibly converted and coerced into marriage, the commission also noted lack of several basics of life.

The HRCP report also mentioned how minorities in Pakistan have faced hardships over the years,

and also highlighted the plight of women in Pakistan,

Therefore, it is established that the viral pictures of violence are NOT from Telinipara in West Bengal’s Hooghly district but from different incidents of anti-Hindu violence in Pakistan, where minorities have faced constant violence.

It is also to be noted that viral pictures are also of different incidents of atrocities against Hindus in Pakistan. The viral claims that the images are of West Bengal are absolutely false.
