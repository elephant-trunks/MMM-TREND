However, Fact Crescendo found that there were ten education ministers from 1947 to 1977. Out of which four were non-Muslims.

FACT CHECK

Department of School Education and Literacy has a list of all the education ministers of India from 1947 to 2021.

According to the information, there were ten education ministers in India from 1947 to 1977.

First minister was Maulana Abul Kalam Azad from 15 August 1947 to 22 February 1958.

His successor Dr. K.L Shrimali served from 1958 to 1963.

Shri Humayun Kabir held office from 1 September 1963 to 13 November 1963.

Shri M.C. Chagla and Shri Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed were education ministers from 1963-66 and 1966-67 respectively.

Other Ministers were Dr. Triguna Sen, Dr. V.K.R.V Rao, Shri Siddhartha Shankar Ray, Prof. Nurul Hassan, and Prof. Pratap Chandra Chunder.

From the above facts, we can clearly see that from 1947 to 1977 there were ten education ministers and out of that four were non-Muslims.

Conclusion:

Fact Crescendo found that the claim is misleading. India had both Muslims and non-Muslims as education ministers after independence.
