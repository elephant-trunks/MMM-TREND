A video showing a man furiously shouting at a public gathering, which snowballs into a physical fight within the crowd, is being shared on social media.

The claim accompanying the video states that it shows workers from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena engaging in a brawl amid the ongoing political crisis in the state of Maharashtra.
