A video is reaching the wider audience on social media, showing people pushing a car on the flooded road. It is claimed that this is from Sri Ganganagar in Rajasthan.

The video is shared on Facebook with a Hindi caption: “श्रीगंगानगर के हालात” (English translation: Sri Ganganagar’s condition)

Here’s the link to the above post.

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim, and found it to be MISLEADING.

We carefully checked the video and saw that the initial letter of the car’s number plate reads ‘H’.

Also, towards the end of the video, we saw ‘Chopra Electricals’ written on one of the shut shops. Taking this cue, we ran a Google search with ‘Chopra Electricals’ shops in Haryana or Himachal. The top result showed a shop in Haryana’s Rohtak.

We searched further and found images in Google Maps that matched the viral video. Thus, it can be concluded that the video is from the Rohtak area of Haryana.

AAP Haryana had also tweeted a similar video from the same neighbourhood on July 1, 2022, with a caption: “In Rohtak, Haryana, the whole city was submerged in a boat-like situation. The state government’s inaction came out openly in the first rain of the season. Development work has been hampered due to massive corruption.”

Earlier, NewsMobile debunked the same video, where it was being passed off as that from Delhi.
