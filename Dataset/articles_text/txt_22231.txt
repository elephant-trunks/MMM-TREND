In this Special Report, India Today's Principal Correspondent Mustafa Shaikh reports live from Worli on the historic reunion of Uddhav and Raj Thackeray ahead of the crucial BMC elections. After a 'crushing defeat' in the 2024 Assembly polls, the estranged cousins have joined forces to consolidate the 'Marathi Manoos' vote bank against the ruling Mahayuti alliance. Mustafa highlights the emergence of the 'Fakta Thackeray Brand' slogan as a key narrative in this high-stakes battle for Mumbai. The report explores whether this emotional reunion can overcome the dominance of the BJP and Eknath Shinde's faction, which recently swept the local body elections. With the Congress opting out of the alliance for now, the 'Thackeray Brand' faces a litmus test in its bid to reclaim the prestigious civic body.
