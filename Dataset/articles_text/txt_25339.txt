This is how they works. They will divide and create sections in #Hindu society. Nadars in Kerala/Tamilnadu, a section of Reddys in Andhra/Telangana and they have aimed Lingayats in Karnataka. Congress has became totally anti Hindu and is easing paths for evangelists to convert pic.twitter.com/JPsC1qaqmM — Pratheesh Viswanath (@pratheesh_vhp) May 16, 2018

The Lingayat divide is @INCIndia project. Minority status is the first step.

Target is conversion. They have carried this out successfully among Shaivas of Tamilnadu. pic.twitter.com/AbLwR5I2i8 — Aashu 🚩 (@AashuSpeak) May 16, 2018
