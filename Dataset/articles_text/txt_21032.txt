Cyclone Litva is steadily moving towards the northern Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts, prompting red alerts across multiple districts in southern India. The storm has already brought heavy rainfall to Nagapattinam and Mayiladurai, where certain areas recorded 220 mm of rain. Over 50 flights have been cancelled at Chennai airport, and schools and colleges remain closed as a precautionary measure. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has deployed 28 teams to assist as the state braces for the cyclone. According to the update, the cyclone is expected to travel parallel to the coast without making landfall, but will bring significant rainfall. The administration has advised locals and tourists to stay indoors, and fishermen have been warned not to venture into the sea due to rough conditions. The Chief Minister has also taken stock of the situation, ensuring safety measures are in place.
