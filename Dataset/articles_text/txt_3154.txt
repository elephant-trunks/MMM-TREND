As Bangladesh witnessed its one of the worst floods in years — forcing millions of people to flee their homes — a video is widely shared on social media, showing a group of cattle being washed away in Sylhet, Bangladesh.

The video is being shared on Facebook with the caption: “সিলেটে বন্যার কিভাবে গরু ছাগল বেসে যাচ্ছে ।” (English translation: Cows and goats are getting drowned in the Sylhet flood.)

Here’s the link to the above post.

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim, and found it to be FAKE.

Using the InVid tool, we extracted keyframes from the video and performed a Reverse Image Search. This search directed us to the official YouTube channel “Imagen Noticias”, which carried the same video on July 28, 2020. According to the video description, these were scenes related to the incident of Jakulpan river in Nayarit (Mexico), where cattle were washed away.

Taking a cue from this, we searched the web and found a news article published on July 28, 2020, on the same incident.

We found the same video uploaded on a Twitter post, dated July 28, 2020, with the caption: “WORLD – Cows are washed away by flood after a high volume of rain caused by the hurricane #Hanna in Compostela, Nayarit, Mexico.”

On digging further, we also found the same video on Joranda.com.mx, dated July 28, 2020, claiming that the video is from Hanna, in which thousands of people were affected because of the torrential rains, followed by a storm.

Earlier, NewsMobile had also exposed the viral video, which claimed that cattle were washed away in Kerala floods.

Thus, the viral video in question is from Hanna, Mexico, having no connection with the recent Bangladesh floods.
