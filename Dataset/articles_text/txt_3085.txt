A video of a buffalo being shot is being widely shared on social media. The video is being shared extensively in context of Eid-ul-Adha with a caption hinting that that the incident happened in India.

The video is shared with a caption that reads, “एक जानवर के लिए इतने हथियार निकले हैं और हथियारों की कैटेगरी पर भी ध्यान दीजिए। आप कहा हो ?? ये विडियो मेरे वाटस्अप पर आई है” (English translation: So many weapons have come out for one animal and also pay attention to the category of weapons. where are you ?? This video came on my WhatsApp)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did a fact-check and found the claim to be misleading.

On doing a Google Reverse Image search with one of the screenshots, we found that the same video was uploaded on GeoTv on July 21, 2021. The title of the report read, “Karachi men shoot bull after it escapes, gets out of control before qurbaani.”

We further found a report on Gulf News which had also uploaded a screenshot of the video on July 22, 2021. According to the report, “a buffalo which went on the rampage was shot at multiple times in Karachi on Eid Al Adha before it was sacrificed as the owners tried to avoid human and property loss.”

Thus, we can ascertain that the viral video is from Karachi, Pakistan, and not India. Hence, the viral claim is misleading.
