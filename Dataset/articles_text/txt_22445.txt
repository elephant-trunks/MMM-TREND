India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is more than two years old and related to smuggling of currency. However, it is not clear when and where this video was recorded.

Till the filing of this story, the post was shared over 13,000 times and liked by almost 8,000 users. The archived version can be seen here.

To verify the claim along with the viral video, we separated it into keyframes and ran a reverse search on one of them. Through the Russian search engine Yandex, we found a photo story by Daily Bhaskar published on October 31, 2017.

According to this report, the video shows how smugglers are using fruits to smuggle currency notes. However, it also says, It is not clear who recorded this video and where it was shot or whether the currency is fake, but it being reported to be of Pakistan.

This is not the only incident of currency being smuggled in bananas being reported. We found a media report published in February 2017, when two persons were arrested at Karipur airport in Kerala for attempting to smuggle in Saudi riyals in bananas.

Therefore, it is clear that the viral video is more than two years old and has nothing to do with the recent violence in Delhi.
