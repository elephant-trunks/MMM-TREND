A shocking video of a man swept away by a river while trying to fetch coconuts is circulating with the claim that the incident is from Andhra Pradesh.

In the 21-second clip, a few men and women are seen gathered near a coconut tree on the banks of a river. As some of them tried to climb the tree, the ground beneath gave away and the entire tree fell into the river. The men too disappeared in the turbulent waters.

A Facebook page posted the video with the caption “Andhra Pradesh”, which garnered 2.4 million views till the time of filing this article.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is from last year and the incident took place at Vig­a del Fuerte, a small town in Colombia. One of the men named Arturo was actually washed away by the Arqu­a river and later rescued by neighbours.

Using reverse image search, we found that Colombian news channel “Caracol TV” had aired the news along with the video in November 2020.

As per the report, a man named Arturo, along with two more people, was swept away by the Arqu­a river while trying to fetch coconuts from a tree near the bank.

The incident took place at Vig­a del fuerte, a Colombian town in Antioquia department. As per the news report, two men somehow managed to swim to the bank, but Arturo was washed away due to the strong currents. Two boats set out in his rescue mission, and he was later found alive two kilometres down the river by neighbours.

The YouTube channel of “Caracol TV” uploaded the video along with the ground report on November 16, 2020.

Hence, the viral claim saying that the video is from Andhra Pradesh is misleading, as the incident actually took place last year in a small Colombian town.
