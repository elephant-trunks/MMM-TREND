Just before Sachin Pilot was announced to be the deputy chief minister of Rajasthan, a photo started circulating on social media which tried to show him in bad light.

Facebook posts with these photos claimed that the leader who aspires to be the chief minister of Rajasthan, had blackened PM Narendra Modi's face on posters.

The caption on one such post reads -- "He is the same Sachin Pilot who is about to become the chief minister of Rajasthan. He has blackened PM Narendra Modi's face on a poster. Share this post widely, so that it becomes news by tomorrow."

The photos are being shared widely on social media. At the time of writing this report, the pictures had already been shared about 7,000 times from different Facebook profiles. Netizens started slamming Sachin Pilot for the act.

India Today Fact Check team found that the person in the photos is not Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee chief Sachin Pilot, but the president of Maharashtra Youth Congress -- Satyajeet Tambe.

When we reverse searched the photo, we got the clue that the man in the photo is Maharashtra Youth Congress president Satyajit Tambe. On scanning Tambe's Twitter profile, we found that on October 11, 2018, Tambe had himself posted a video in which he can be seen blackening PM Modi's face on a poster as a mark of protest against rising fuel prices.

We reached out to Satyajit Tambe, who confirmed that the man in the viral photo is not Sachin Pilot but indeed himself.

On October 11 itself, BJP Maharashtra's had also criticised Satyajeet Tambe's for the act.

Thus it can be concluded that Sachin Pilot did not tarnish PM Modi's poster.
