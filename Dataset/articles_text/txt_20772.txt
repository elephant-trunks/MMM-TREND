In October 2021, Sukmawati Sukarnoputri of Indonesia converted to Hinduism. In connection to this, many users in India posted a claim that the ‘princess of Indonesia’ converted to Hinduism following which 50,000 Indonesians did the same. Indonesia has the world’s largest population of Muslims.

The power of queen and her followers… https://t.co/BC9yJzQRRe — रूपा भाटी Rupa Bhaty (@ArchitectRupa) November 25, 2021

Fact-Check:

Firstly, Sukmawati Sukarnoputri is not the princess of Indonesia. She is the daughter of the founding father and first president of Indonesia, Sukarno. She did indeed convert to Hinduism on October 26,2021. This however already renders a claim slightly misleading.

Secondly, we scanned the internet to find out whether ‘50,000’ people converted to Hinduism after her conversion and could not find anything at all. There are no local on international reports on the mass conversions as of now.

Therefore, this claim is completely fake.
