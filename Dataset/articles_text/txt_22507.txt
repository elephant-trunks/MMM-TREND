A video of policemen manhandling men, women and children is going viral on social media with the claim that people are being evicted from their homes as a fallout of the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Facebook user "Denzil Brown" posted the video with the caption, "NRC started in Assam. They have begun evicting people from their homes. The media doesn't show it, they are being sold, so it is our responsibility now to share this video."

AFWA could not find any credible news report related to the video but the arm badges of policemen are clearly visible, which helped us ascertain that they are Rajasthan police.

Using a combination of reverse search and related keywords, we found a tweet by user "Bharat Prabhat Party" who posted the same video and said it is from Kanota village in Jaipur where police are demolishing the houses of Dalits, poor and tribal people. The user tweeted the video on August 7, 2019.

Further investigation took us to a YouTube channel called "ZERO NEWS" where other videos of the incident are available. The details of these videos also say that the incident took place in Kanota village of Jaipur where policemen destroyed one part of a house without prior JDA notice.

To verify the incident, we reached out to Kanota police station where an officer confirmed that the viral video is from an anti-encroachment drive by JDA in the village. He said the drive took place in August last year and has nothing to do with NRC.

With the help of Kanota police station, AFWA contacted inspector Rajiv Yaduvanshi, who was part of the drive and is also seen in the video. Yaduvanshi told us, "Some people had encroached the common way and built a wall on it. We demolished the wall after which a scuffle broke out between police and the encroachers."

Therefore, it is clear that the video of an anti-encroachment drive in Jaipur is being shared as people being evicted from their houses in Assam after NRC.
