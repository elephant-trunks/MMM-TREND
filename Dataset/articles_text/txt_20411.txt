In our fact check analysis we checked official the site and social media handle of Burj Khalifa but we did not find any such news. Further, on keyword research, we found the same video on the handle of Noxious_Numaira. She had also uploaded the viral video on her YouTube Channel on March 24, 2022.

Then, we found another tweet on her account in which she had shared a screenshot. And, she had clarified that the video was edited. Along with the screen grab she wrote, “This is amazing. In the Video my Twitter handle is watermarked & my YouTube channel is linked

At both the places I’ve mentioned that I have edit videos/pics. Still, if people think that it is real then I’m the Goddess of VFX. It’s not my fault if people think it is real.”

This is amazing

Video mein mera Twitter handle watermarked hai & my YouTube channel is linked

Dono jaga I've mentioned that I edit videos/pics

Ab agar phir bhi logon ko sach lagta hai toh bhai phir I'm the Goddess of VFX 🤓
