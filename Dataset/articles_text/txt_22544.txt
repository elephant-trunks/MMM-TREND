A video of an old man, wearing white dhoti, kurta and turban, went viral on social media with the claim that it was Saryu Roy, independent candidate from Jamshedpur East, dancing on a famous Bollywood number after defeating former Jharkhand chief minister Raghubar Das.

Roy was earlier part of the Raghubar Das cabinet, but contested as an Independent after being denied a ticket in the recently concluded Jharkhand assembly elections.

Facebook user "Mahtab Hussain" uploaded the video with a caption in Hindi that translates to, "Must see Saryu Roy's dance after defeating Raghubar Das." In the video, the old man is seen dancing on what looks like a dance floor. See video here

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is nearly three years old and the man seen dancing is not MLA Saryu Roy.

Till the filing of this story, the video had been shared by over 5,000 Facebook users. The archived version of the post can be seen here.

Many users on Facebook as well as Twitter have shared the video with the same claim.

Some media houses have also used the video.

AFWA probe

After selecting a few key frames in the video, we did a reverse search which led us to some YouTube uploads of the very video. This video was uploaded on January 18, 2017. So clearly, it has nothing to do with the Jharkhand assembly election results declared on December 23. This video has been shared widely as "Tau ka dance" or "Dadaji dancing".

We also spoke to Saryu Roy himself. Fresh after the election victory, he said, "I am not the man dancing in that video. I don't even know who is dancing in that video but would like to appreciate his sense of humor. The video has been released on the right time and right occasion!!"

Thus, it is clear that the viral video is not of Saryu Roy. It is an old video. AFWA, however, could not independently find the identity of the person seen in the viral video.
