A 45-second video clip is circulating on social media with the claim that it shows an Indian satellite colliding with the International Space Station and that an American astronaut Michael Collins died in the mishap.

It was shared on Twitter here.

FACT CHECK

An image search with key frames of the video showed that it was part of a longer 3D video game uploaded on the Instagram page by CGI artist Aleksey Patrev from Ukraine. The video was uploaded on July 27, 2021, with hashtag #animation and was shared on his YouTube channel and Instagram as well.

Aleksey had also said the movie “Gravity” inspired him to create the video. Hence, it is clear that the video in question is a 3D animation and does not show an Indian satellite colliding with the International Space Station.

Coming to the second claim that American astronaut Michael Collins died in the mishap is absolutely baseless. He was one of the three of Apollo mission that landed on the moon along with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in Apollo 11. He had died of cancer aged 90 in April 2021 and was not killed in the space incident as claimed.

Claim: Video shows the collision of an under-maintenance Indian satellite with the International Space Station. American astronaut Michael Collins died during the incident.

Conclusion :This is a 3D animation video created by CGI artist Aleksey Patrev. American astronaut Michael Collins of Apollo 11 fame died of cancer at the age of 90 in April 2021.

Rating: The claim is totally False —
