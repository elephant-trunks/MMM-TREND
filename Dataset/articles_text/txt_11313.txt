Beginning the investigation, we found the above video on YouTube through Keywords. As a result, we found a YouTube video aired on September 29th 2014, titled “Rajdeep Sardesai Fight in New York”.

On searching keywords for this event, we found news articles related to this incident. Regarding this incident, Rajdeep Sardesai himself tweeted from his official Twitter account and said that “Great crowd at Modison Square Garden! Except a few idiots who still believe abuse is a way of proving their machismo.” He tweeted this on 28th September 2014.”

The incident, published on 29th September 2014 by The New York Times, wrote that the clash between the Modi supporters at Madison Square and Indian journalist Rajdeep Sardesai was apparently because of his failure to share their enthusiasm for Mr Modi.Rajdeep Sardesai found himself in a strange clash of pushes, insult and slaps with a man who harassed him during his live reporting.

Apart from this, in the viral video, “Square Garden” can be seen written in the background. When we found Madison Square Garden in New York, the results showed that both the sign boards are the same. Below you can see the comparative picture of both.

Conclusion: After fact-checking, we have found the above post completely incorrect. Claims made via viral video on social media are untrue, this video is of a clash that happened way back in 2014 between journalist Rajdeep Saradesai and some people in New York, which is being spread with a fake claim that Rajdeep Sardesai was attacked by the public for interviewing Riya Chakravarty.
