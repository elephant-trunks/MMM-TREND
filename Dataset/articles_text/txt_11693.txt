Fact

We conducted Google reverse image search on the keyframes of the viral video which led us to a report by Aaj Tak, dated June 4, 2022. As per the report, a woman gave birth to a baby with a rare genetic disorder that affects skin development. The nerves of the newborn are also clearly visible because of said disorder and the baby’s organs are not fully developed, the report added. The newborn was kept in the ICU for treatment. The incident was reported from Badawada in Madhya Pradesh’s Ratlam.

Further, Newschecker contacted the in charge of the ICU at Ratlam District Hospital, Dr Naved Qureshi who told us, “The child seen in the viral video was from near Ratlam. The child had a rare disorder, called Harlequin ichthyosis in medical science. It is difficult for a newborn with this condition to survive. The child died after 5-6 days of birth. The claim that the child was given 50 injections containing poison or was beheaded and buried is totally false.”

Harlequin ichthyosis is a severe genetic disorder that affects the skin. Children with this condition are born prematurely with very hard, thick skin covering most of their bodies. These skin abnormalities affect the shape of the eyelids, nose, mouth, and ears, and limit movement of the arms and legs.

Result: False
