So this is all in the last few days in one area. Watch the 3 videos and then the final picture was taken at my place yesterday – @umganulodge. I’m really hoping a nasty accident doesn’t happen soon. But, the good news though, is that we humans are not a predators prey. We also know that these animals are treated with utmost respect so they do live very well alongside humans in the Sabi Sands area. It’s fascination to see though that coming out of a full lockdown in SA, these animals are being seen by the public a lot closer to rooms/reception areas. Possibly due to their territories shifting without humans being around or they just feel less pressure being in those areas cos they’ve been doing it for the last 6 months with no one around. We have to protect these beautiful creatures. We have to respect their space. Never get over familiar cos that’s when an accident could happen & the human won’t win! Anyway, enjoy these videos! Nature is THE BEST! ❤️
