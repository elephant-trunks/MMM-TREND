A video is swiftly shared on social media, showing a woman spitting at police while taken into custody. And the video claims that the woman is Teesta Setalvad — a civil rights activist and journalist.

The video is shared with a caption: “यह हैं देश की महान स्वयं सेविका श्रीमती तीस्ता सीतलवाड़। कितनी शालीन कितनी सौम्या! दूसरी तरफ हमारे पुलिस महिला की सहनशक्ति का बेजोड़ दृश्य भारतीय पुलिस गर्व के योग्य हैं।” (English translation: “This is the great social activist of the country, Mrs Teesta Setalvad. How peaceful and kind! On the other hand, the unmatched view of the stamina of female constables. Indian police are worthy of pride.”)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did the fact-check, and found it to be fake.

On doing a Google Reverse Image Search with one of the keyframes of the viral video, we found the same video was uploaded by India Today on June 21, 2022. It was shared with a description: “Mahila Congress acting president Netta D’Souza on Tuesday caught on camera, spitting at security personnel while protesting against the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for questioning former Congress president Rahul Gandhi in the National Herald case”

Newswire ANI had also tweeted the same video on June 21, 2022, with a caption: “Mahila Congress President Netta D’Souza spits at police personnel during a protest with party workers in Delhi against ED for questioning Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in the National Herald case.”

Hence, we can ascertain that the woman in the viral video is not Teesta Setalavd but Mahila Congress president Netta D’Souza. Thus, the viral claim is fake.
