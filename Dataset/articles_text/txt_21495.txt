On the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi, an image of former South African cricketer AB de Villiers holding a Ganpati idol has gone viral. People are sharing it with ‘#happyganeshchaturthi’ hashtags on social media.

An Instagram fan page of the cricketer posted this image with the caption, “Happy Ganesh Chaturthi”.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral image is doctored. In the original picture, AB de Villiers can be seen holding a trophy and not a Ganesha idol. This image was taken at a press conference in London during the ‘ICC Champions Trophy 2017’ tournament.

“May Bappa blesses RCB with a Trophy this year!” a user wrote in the comment section of the viral post.

In the backdrop of the viral image, “Champions Trophy” and “2017” can be seen. This gave us a clue that this image could be related to the ‘ICC Champions Trophy 2017’.

After a Google reverse image search of the viral photo, we found that it was tweeted by the International Cricket Council (ICC) on June 3, 2017. In the original image, de Villiers can be seen holding a trophy, and not an idol.

This picture was taken at the press conference held on June 2, 2017, during the ICC Champions Trophy cricket tournament. In this press conference, de Villiers (who was the captain of the South African cricket team at that time ) had addressed the media, on the eve of his team’s match with Sri Lanka.

This image was also carried by a British news website ‘Express’ in a report published on June 3, 2017.

Recently, the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) franchise had announced the arrival of the batting maestro AB de Villiers in the UAE for the second leg of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2021. It is set to kick off on September 19.

Though it is true that Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated in several countries, evidently a morphed picture of AB de Villiers is being circulated on this occasion that shows him holding Lord Ganesha’s idol.
