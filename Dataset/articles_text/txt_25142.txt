Truth



The Newspaper Rahul Gandhi is reading is not in Kannada but is English.

The photograph is from 2017 when National Herald, a newspaper founded by Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru was re-launched.

We have previously debunked the same claim in 2017 when it went viral after the event.

Few screenshots of the video above of Inner pages of the Newspaper he is reading which proves it to be in English

The newspaper in question is not a Kannada newspaper, but an English one which has Kannada advertisements on front and back pages. You can see the inner pages of the commemorative re-launch edition of the National Herald here.

In an exclusive, SMHoaxSlayer received video of the same paper with all inner pages turned which proves the paper to be in English with Kannada advertisemtn on front.

A video of the re-launch event was found on Telugu news channel Sakshi TV’s YouTube channel.

Indian Express’s millennial content focused subsidiary, InUth published some high-resolution images from the event in an article.

Thus, Rahul Gandhi is not reading a Kannada newspaper, it is an English newspaper with Kannada advertisements on its front and back pages.
