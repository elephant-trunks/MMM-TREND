India Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is a scene from the movie ‘Our Hospitality’ - a silent comedy directed by Buster Keaton in 1923.

A movie scene

With the help of InVid and reverse image search, we found a screenshot from the video that was published in a blog that claimed that this was a scene from ‘Our Hospitality’. The blog claimed that the train shown in the film was a replica of Robert Stephenson’s ‘rocket’ locomotive.

Taking this clue, we found the entire movie ‘Our Hospitality’ on YouTube. The same sequence of events is repeated in several scenes throughout the movie.

‘Our Hospitality’ was released by Metro Pictures Corporation. Buster Keaton directed, produced, wrote and even acted in the movie. The movie was set in 1830.

The first locomotive

Stockton & Darlington in England is the first railway company in the world which operated freight and passenger services using a steam locomotive engine. As per Britannica.com, the first engine built by George Stephenson ran from Darlington to Stockton on September 27, 1825, with wagons carrying 450 people at a speed of 15 miles per hour.

However, the world’s first steam engine used in mines was built by Richard Trevithick. On February 21, 1804, Trevithick’s steam engine carried 10 tons of iron and 70 men for nearly ten miles from Penydarren in the UK at a speed of five miles per hour.
