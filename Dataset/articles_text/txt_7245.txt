A photo of an old man is being shared widely on social media with a claim that he is 82-year-old Md Barkat Ali who failed 47 times in 10th Class exams. It is also being claimed that he finally passed in 2020 as 10th Class exams were cancelled in Telangana due to COVID-19. But, FACTLY has found that he is Shiv Charan Yadav, a resident of Rajasthan, who failed 47 times in 10th Class exams conducted by ‘Board of Secondary Education – Rajasthan’. He gave his 47th attempt in 2016 and it was widely reported by news agencies that he failed again in that year. So, he has no connection to 10th Class exams cancelled by the State government in Telangana. Also, as of today, the Rajasthan Government has not taken any decision to cancel the 10th Class exams. Recently, the dates for the remaining 10th Class exams were also announced in Rajasthan, which can be seen here and here.
