FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found it to be misleading.

We extracted keyframes of the video using the InVid tool and put them through Reverse Image Search. The results led us through several news reports featuring similar keyframes from the same video. We found the same video in an NDTV report dated June 3, 2022 on their official YouTube channel.

According to the reports, the incident took place in Gujarat’s Vadodara on June 2, 2022, at Deepak Nitrite Company in Nandesari GIDC and eight people were reportedly injured.

Hence, with the above findings, we can conclude that the video in question is from Gujarat’s Vadodara and NOT from Ghaziabad.
