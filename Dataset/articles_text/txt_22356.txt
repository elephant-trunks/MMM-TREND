India Today Anti Fake News Room (AFWA) has found that the video is not from India but Pakistan. The man seen in the video addressing the crowd is Mufti Kifayatullah, a leader of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F).

As per media reports published on April 13, a large number of people had gathered for a funeral in Pakistan's Mansehra last week. This is where the Mufti had addressed the gathering.

The Mufti said, "If you do this, we will be forced to think that mosques are being deserted on America's instructions. We are ready to give our lives, but not ready to desert our mosques."

We found the longer version of the viral video shot from a different angle. This video was uploaded by YouTube channel "Mufti Kifayatullah Official" on April 7. The title of the video says, "Mufti Kifayatullah position regarding the closure of mosques under the cover of corona."

The viral part of the speech can be heard from 2.35 minutes.

We also found a tweet claiming that the Mufti has been arrested for the speech.
