To make the video go viral, the team of DFRAC reverse searched some of the frames of the video. During this, we found a video uploaded on 10th June 2022 on the official YouTube channel of “NDTV”. The caption of this video “Cop Opens Fire Outside Bangladesh High Commission In Kolkata, Kills Self”

According to this NDTV report, a police constable posted at the Bangladesh High Commission in Kolkata fired several rounds before shooting himself today. A woman reportedly died during this firing.

This fact check proves that the claims being made by social media users are misleading and false. The death of the policeman does not appear to be from the protesters, but it appears to be a suicide committed by him.
