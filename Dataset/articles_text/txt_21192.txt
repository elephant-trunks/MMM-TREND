In the weeks leading up to it, there was already plenty of social media misinformation in the form of videos and images about the Russia-Ukraine conflict. But following Moscow’s all-out attack, even the amount of misinformation has escalated.

Several people shared a video of a massive explosion. The claim along with it was that this happened in Ukraine amid the ongoing crisis.

This video of the explosion, shared by many, mentioned words like “Massive explosion at Ukraine”, and the hashtag #RussiaUkraineConflict.

The archived version of this video can be seen here and here.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found this claim to be misleading. The video has nothing to do with the ongoing Ukraine-Russia crisis. The video, almost five years old, is of an army warehouse in Ukraine.

With the help of the InVid tool and reverse image search, we found the video of the same explosion on a website named Popular Mechanics. This website carried this video with a report published on September 27, 2017. The report noted that it was an explosion in a Ukrainian ammunition dump in Vinnytsya, about 160 miles southwest of Ukraine's capital Kyiv.

Taking this as a cue, we searched some combinations of keywords and came across a report published in the Daily Mail on September 17, 2017. The report stated that Russia allegedly dropped bombs with the help of drones, causing a massive fire in the warehouse where 188,000 tons of ammunition was stored, leading to an evacuation of almost 30,000 locals.

Here in the Daily Mail report, we can see a photograph by Reuters of the massive explosion which happened in central Ukraine.

British media outlet IBTimes UK also uploaded the same video on its YouTube channel on September 27, 2017.

Thus, we can conclude that this explosion has no relation to the ongoing attack of Ukraine by Russia.
