AFWA’s investigation revealed that this is not the photo of Kanhaiya Lal, the tailor who was killed in Udaipur on Tuesday. This illustration was made from an old photograph that was shot in Jodhpur.

AFWA Probe

While investigating the claim, we conducted a reverse search of this illustration and found out that the illustration was made using a photo. We found the photo on Shutterstock. Per the website of the American stock media company, the photo was taken in Jodhpur on March 28, 2015.

The viral illustration and this photo look identical. But to make things clear, we compared the illustration with the actual photo of Kanhaiya Lal.

Several news outlets have carried the photo of Kanhaiya Lal in their reports. Comparing the two, it was clear that they do not look alike.

We thus concluded that the illustration is not of Kanhaiya Lal, rather it was made using a 2015 photograph of a tailor from Jodhpur.
