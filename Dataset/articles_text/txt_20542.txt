Fact check

After cross-checking the credibility of the image, we found an image on the page of CNN. The Lead CNN posted the same image where we can find the same news window having a picture of Putin and the anchor on the other side. In the original picture, the headline is that Putin interferes in the US election of 2020.

The Lead CNN posted the tweet in 2019 and captions it with ‘Russian interference in U.S. elections now comedy fodder for Kremlin’.
