An image of Rahul Gandhi standing in a sweet shop is being posted on Facebook by users. In the image it can be seen that there is a sign on the door that says ‘ राहूल गाँधी के प्रधानमंत्री बनने तक उधारी बन्द।’

This particular picture is being posted mostly on Facebook.

Upon further investigation, we found that this particular claim was posted as far back as 2018.

Fact-Check:

We performed a reverse image search on the claim and found that the images were indeed posted first in 2018. The original image was first posted by Qazi Nizamuddin who is the Secretary of All India Congress Committee. As per the image, Rahul Gandhi visited a sweet shop after his rally. In the image, it can be seen that the notice on the glass front does not say the phrase claimed by the users and it looks to be clearly photoshopped.

Therefore, this claim is false.
