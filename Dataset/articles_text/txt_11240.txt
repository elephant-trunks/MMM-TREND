Fact Crescendo contacted Shahnawaz Hussain, UP’s District Chairman Minority Department who confirmed “The list shows the names of the chairmen from the minority cell which means that the elected chairman would also be from the minority community, and not the majority community.”

Conclusion- Fact Crescendo found that the viral image on social media is being shared without context. The list shows the District Chairmen appointed by the Congress in December 2020 for its Minority Department in Uttar Pradesh. This is the reason why the list has names from the Muslim/minority community only.
