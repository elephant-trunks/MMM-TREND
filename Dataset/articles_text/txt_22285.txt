In an exclusive conversation with India Today, the Unnao rape survivor expressed her anguish after the Delhi High Court suspended the life sentence of expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar. The survivor, who staged a protest at India Gate, stated, ‘This judgment has broken the morale of every daughter.’ She vowed to challenge the order in the Supreme Court, fearing for her life and her family's safety. The High Court granted relief to Sengar on the technical ground that an MLA is not a ‘public servant’ under the POCSO Act. India Today’s Nalini Sharma explains the legal nuances of the verdict.
