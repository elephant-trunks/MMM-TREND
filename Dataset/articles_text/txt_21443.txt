Prototype of Asia's first hybrid flying car was recently unveiled at the world's largest Helitech Expo-Excel in London. Chennai-based startup company 'Vinata Aeromobility' is developing this car. The design model of the car was also showcased before Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia last month.

Soon after, several netizens began claiming that Mohammad Furqan Shoaib, the Chief Technology Officer of Vinata Aeromobility - the company that developed it - was deprived of his due credit just because he is a Muslim. It is being claimed that Shoaib is the person who 'created' Asia's first hybrid flying car.

India Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral claim is misleading.
