A year after Narendra Modi took office as prime minister, claims by the Ministry of Tourism of an 8% increase in foreign tourist arrivals and a 10% increase in foreign-exchange earnings appear unexceptional.

We emailed our findings to the ministry last week, requesting comment. There was no response.

1. Foreign-tourist arrivals grew 8.1%--which is below the 11-year average.

Claim: Foreign-tourist arrivals increased 8.1% between successive years 2014-15 and 2013-14.

Check revealed: The 8.1% jump turns out to be below the 11-year average. The official figures for foreign-tourist arrivals in India for 11 years, between 2004 and 2014, show a year-on-year average growth of more than 10 %.

Year Foreign Tourist Arrivals in India Annual Growth (%) 2004 34,574,77 26.8 2005 39,18,610 13.3 2006 44,47,167 13.5 2007 50,81,504 14.3 2008 52,82,603 4 2009 51,67,699 -2.2 2010 57,75,692 11.8 2011 63,09,222 9.2 2012 65,77,745 4.3 2013 69,67,601 5.9 2014 77,03,386 10.6 Total 60,688,706 Avg. of 11 years = 10.1%

2. Foreign-exchange earnings: 10% increase--same as seven of past 11 years.

Claim: Foreign-exchange earnings increased 10% to $17 billion during 2014-15, compared to $15.5 billion during 2013-14.

Check revealed: An analysis of data reveals that these earnings, in US dollars, increased more than 10% (year-on-year basis) in seven out of the past 11 years.

Year Foreign-Exchange Earnings (in US $ billion) % change over previous year 2004 6.2 38.2 2005 7.5 21.4 2006 8.6 15.2 2007 10.7 24.3 2008 11.8 10.3 2009 11.1 -3.7 2010 14.2 27.5 2011 16.6 16.7 2012 17.7 7.1 2013 18.5 4 2014 19.7 6.6
