India Today's Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video was recorded more than a year ago and has no relation with the election results.

Many users have shared the video on Facebook as well.

AFWA has found that the video is of March, 2018, when Tej Pratap got engaged in Patna, Bihar. Both the brothers were dancing in the engagement ceremony.

The video is available on YouTube.

The Rashtriya Janta Dal (RJD) could not win even a single seat out of 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar.

RJD patriarch Lalu Yadav is in Ranchi jail after being convicted in the fodder scam case. According to some media reports, he had given up on food after the Lok Sabha debacle.
