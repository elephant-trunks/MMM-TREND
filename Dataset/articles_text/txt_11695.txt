A short video showing a man throwing himself under a truck full of Kanwar Yatris is being shared to claim that a Muslim man deliberately carried out the act, to put the blame of his death on Hindu devotees and cause communal tensions.

The video, which shows buses and trucks passing on a busy street and a Muslim man abruptly throwing himself under a passing truck, is being widely shared on social media, days after two Kanwariyas (Kanwar Yatra devotees) died in a road mishap near Uttar Pradesh's Amroha, leading to unrest.
