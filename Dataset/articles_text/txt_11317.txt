FACT-CHECK

A reverse image search on the key-frames of the video revealed that it is available on the internet since 2018. Sifting through various links in combination with key-words, we came across a Switzerland Ultras Facebook Page where the same video was uploaded on 21st May 2018.

Taking a clue from it, we searched about this incident. An Italian website Tia-20 has uploaded the same video along with the related news. According to it, the video is from Basel, Switzerland.

The said vandalism took place after a football match between Basel and Lucerne teams on 19th May 2018. Fans of the rival teams clashed with each other and some hooligans vandalized the passing vehicles on the street.

While searching more about it, we found a press release issued by the Public prosecutor of Basel on 20th May 2018. It reads:

“On May 19, 2018, after 11 p.m., violent clashes broke out between “football fans” in Birsstrasse, between the stadium and Redingstrasse. At least two people involved were injured. Several people were checked and two were provisionally arrested.” (Translated by Google)

CONCLUSION

The viral video of hooligans attacking vehicles is not from Sweden and is not related to the recent riots that took place. The video, in fact, is from Switzerland. It shows the violence that erupted between football fans after a match in 2018 in Basel. It is being falsely linked to recent Sweden riots.
