In a promotional clip for Tucker Carlson’s new show, “Tucker Carlson Originals: The End of Men,” the idea of “testicle tanning” was mentioned as a potential way to increase testosterone. After this, an image of a Fox News chyron alluding to the subject began spreading on social media.

In the image, it appears like a photo of Ted Cruz’s wife, Heidi Cruz, along with a Fox News chyron in which she quotes, “Ted Does Not Tan His Testicles.”

Fact Check:

By reverse searching the image we found that Heidi Cruz’s did not quote on Fox News’ website or on verified social media accounts.

Also, the picture of her is digitally morphed.

Conclusion:

The chyron is misleading and digitally morphed.

Claim Review: Fox News chyron quoting Republican Texas Sen.

Claimed by: many social media users.

Fact Check: misleading.
