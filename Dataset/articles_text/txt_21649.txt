Sonia Gandhi has often come under attack from opponents over her family roots. And now, a picture of the Congress president with a book titled “How to Convert India into Christian Nation” on a shelf behind her is circulating on Facebook. The Bible and a statue of Jesus Christ are also seen.

One of the accompanying captions in Hindi along with the picture translates to, “Zoom in and see the name of the book in the shelf (How to Convert India into Christian Nation). Is she a well-wisher of India?”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the picture is morphed. While the title of one of the books on Gandhi’s shelf has been edited to “How to Convert India into Christian Nation”, the Bible and statue of Jesus Christ have been added to the picture.

The picture is being widely circulated on Facebook too. The archived versions can be seen here, here and here.

AFWA probe

We did a reverse search on the picture and found that several reports carried a similar file photo of Sonia with credit to news agency Press Trust of India (PTI).

However, in this version of the image, we can find neither the Bible nor the statue of Jesus Christ on the shelf behind her. Also, the text “How to Convert India into Christian Nation” is edited into a blue book on the shelf.

A comparison between the original and viral pictures can be seen below.

We then traced the actual video from where the screenshot was taken. In the original video, tweeted by Rahul Gandhi on October 27, 2020, Sonia is seen appealing to the people of Bihar to vote for Mahagathbandhan ahead of assembly elections in the state.

It is clear from the video as well that the viral picture is morphed.

The Congress’s official YouTube channel has uploaded several videos of Sonia in front of the same bookshelf.

Hence, it is clear that the viral picture is morphed. While the name of a book on the shelf has been altered, the Bible and statue of Jesus Christ have been added to the picture.
