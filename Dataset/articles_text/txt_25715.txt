A video of a sinkhole in the middle of a huge pond is being circulated online with a claim that it is from Assam.

Facebook users are sharing the video with a caption: “নগাঁৱৰ সুতিৰপাৰ কাটাখাল ৰৌমাৰী বিলৰ আজৱ দৃশ্য।” (English translation: Scene from ROUMARI lake in Sutishal of Katakhal in Nagaon)

Here’s the link to the above post.

FACT CHECK

When NewsMobile fact-checked the post, it was found to be false.

On putting the keyframes from the video through Reverse Image Search, we found the same video uploaded on YouTube in July 2018. The translated title of the video reads: “Bolonha lake overflowing.”

We also found similar videos of Bolonha lake taken from different angles. The video was geotagged to the Utinga State Park in Pará, Brazil.

A few blog posts and articles also confirmed that the video was, indeed, from Utinga State Park in Brazil. They can be read here and here.

Hence, it is clear that the video is not from Assam but Brazil.
