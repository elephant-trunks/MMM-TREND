Several images of a girl have recently gone viral on social media with the claim that she is the latest victim of post-poll violence in West Bengal.

Many Facebook and Twitter users have shared the pictures and claimed that this 20-year-old girl from West Midnapore district was gang-raped and murdered by “Rohingya and Bangladeshi jihadis” for supporting BJP.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that though the rape and murder incident is true, but according to family members and police, there is no communal or political angle to it. Two masons and their female aide were arrested. Both the victim and accused are from the same religion.

The victim’s father spoke to India Today and ruled out any political angle to the incident. He said, “After lunch, she’d gone to clean the utensils as usual, but went missing since then. We started searching all around and finally found her body in an under-construction house next to ours. Three masons, including a woman, were working there and we filed an FIR at the police station.”

Based on FIR filed by the victim’s family at Pingla police station, local police arrested the three accused. They have been identified as B Murmu from Belda, Chhotu Munda from Jharkhand and Tapati Patra from Sabang.

India Today spoke to Rana Mukherjee, additional SP, Kharagpur. “There is no communal or political angle to the incident. Based on the FIR, we arrested the accused. They are from the SC/ST community. They have confessed to the crime. We are reconstructing the crime scene. DNA reports have confirmed rape,” said the IPS officer over phone.

There are several reports of post-poll violence in Bengal. But this particular rape and murder incident is not connected to the ongoing violence in the state.
