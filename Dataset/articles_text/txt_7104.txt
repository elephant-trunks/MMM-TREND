A post is being shared on social media with a claim that B. R. Ambedkar said – “The day a tribal woman becomes the President of India (the highest office), the reservation should be abolished in the country” (translated). Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.

Claim: B. R. Ambedkar said – “The day a tribal woman becomes the President of India (the highest office), the reservation should be abolished in the country” Fact: No evidence was found on the internet to confirm that Ambedkar made that statement. He made no such comments either in the Constitutional Assembly debates or in his books. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.

When we searched on the internet whether Ambedkar made that statement, no proper evidence was found. In the context of Draupadi Murmu being nominated as NDA’s Presidential candidate, if any such statement was made by Ambedkar previously, it would have been highlighted by various media agencies now. But none of them reported any such comments by Ambedkar.

He made no such comments in the Constitutional Assembly debates. Some of his statements in the Constitutional Assembly regarding reservations can be found here, here, here, and here.

Also, the statement was not found in his ‘Annihilation of Caste’, and his other writings and speeches.

To sum it up, there is no evidence to suggest that Ambedkar said – ‘Abolish reservations once a tribal woman becomes Indian President’.
