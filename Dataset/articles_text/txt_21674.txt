India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is not from Mumbai but Medina city of Saudi Arabia. It shows an incident from last year in which vehicles parked outside an apartment were damaged after a balcony collapsed on them during heavy rains and thunderstorm.

AFWA probe

On close observation, we could see a CCTV time stamp on the video, which says 30-07-2020. This gave us an idea that this video is perhaps not recent but from last year.

Reverse searching key frames of the viral video, we found it in a March 27 Facebook post with a caption in Arabic which translates to, "Balcony falls due to strong winds in Al Mugharib Street"

Getting a clue from here, we did a keyword search and found the same video carried in some Arabic news reports by "arabic.rt", "al-marsd" and "3yonnews". According to these reports, the incident took place at Bagdo area of Medina.

Arabic fact-check website "Misbar" also confirmed that the viral video shows an incident from July 2020, in which a portion of a building collapsed on parked cars in Medina, Saudi Arabia.

Thus, it is clear that the viral video is neither related to Tauktae nor is it from Mumbai. It shows an incident from last year when a portion of a building fell over some cars in Medina, Saudi Arabia.
