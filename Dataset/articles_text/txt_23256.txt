The latest victim of fake news is actor Shah Rukh Khan’s film “Zero” that received negative and fake reviews on social media before its release. Some quoted Censor Board members to make their fake reviews sound authentic.

The tirade started with a guessing game on the number of screens the film “Zero” will be released on December 21 and it turned viral until renowned trade analyst Taran Adarsh stepped in to clarify on Twitter that the screen count of Zero is not yet confirmed.

“4200 screens? 4500 screens? 5000 screens?… Overenthusiastic souls on social media keep throwing random numbers vis-à-vis screen count of #Zero… How do these numbers originate? Fact is, the screen count will be finalised only a day prior to its release… Till then, relax! [sic],” he tweeted on his real twitter account @taran_adarsh.

Leaving him behind, another fake message on social media went viral. It quoted a pre-review of the film from the Censor Board itself and said the film was a failure. Fake Twitter accounts of well-known film critics, including Taran Adarsh hit the floor tweeting negative reviews about Zero, causing immense damage to the film much before its release. Some tweets went ahead and wrote off the film in a few lines as seen below, posing as trade analyst Taran Adarsh, twisting the spelling of the analyst to cheat the readers:

#OneWordReview#Zero: DISAPPOINTING.

Rating: ⭐️

All that glitters is NOT gold… Holds true for #Zero… Some engrossing moments in the first hour, that’s about it… Formula-ridden plot, screenplay of convenience, shoddy direction are the main culprits… ???#ZeroReview pic.twitter.com/5Vq4h0hhrF — Taran Adarsh (@Taran_aadaarsh) December 19, 2018

Many people were made to believe it as Taran Adarsh’s real account as the parody account too looked exactly the same on its opening page but for the minute spelling error. The accounts read @Taran_aadaarsh or @Taran_adaarsh confusing people besides damaging the reviewer’s name. No wonder, one reader has raised the question as below:

Second HALF- BELOW Average

Another wrote a tweet impersonating SRK’s wife and trying to gain mileage on spreading negativity of the film:

After watching #Zero i’m 100% sure my husband won’t get clean hit so it means 5-6 years without giving hit movie, it’s shame kind of thing for me but i would make sure @iamsrk focus more on his acting & PR activities!
