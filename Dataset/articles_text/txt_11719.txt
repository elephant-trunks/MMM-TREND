Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann got married on Thursday, 7 July to Dr Gurpreet Kaur in a private ceremony at his house in Chandigarh.

Amid news of the wedding, an impostor account with the handle '@DrGurpreetKaur_' has surfaced on Twitter, claiming to be Kaur.

However, according to the web archives of the account, the handle was previously called '@SulochnaPandey' and '@IndiaUprise', before it was changed to Kaur's name.
