There is already tension over the Jalabhishek at the Shahi Idgah Mosque in Mathura, Uttar Pradesh. At the same time, posts increasing this tension are being made on social media.

A user named Rajat Tiwari tweeted – “In 1670, Aurangzeb broke the temple built on the Krishna Janmabhoomi of Mathura and ordered the idols to be placed in the steps of the Begum Sahiba Masjid in Urdu, there are many proofs of this in the history books. “

Other users also tweeted the same.

Fact-Check:

On investigation in this regard, we found that the user has mentioned Begum Sahiba Masjid which is known as Mubarak Begum Masjid. Since the mosque was built in 1823. Whereas the issue of the decree in 1670 is mentioned.

Therefore, this claim is fake.
