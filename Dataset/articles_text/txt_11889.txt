A 2017 photo of a dislodged mosque dome from Uttar Pradesh's Bulandshahr is being shared with the false claim that it is a photo of Delhi's Jama Masjid after its dome got damaged in the recent thunderstorm.

On May 30, 2022, a fierce thunderstorm in Delhi with strong winds in the evening had left dozens of trees uprooted and a part of the Jama Masjid damaged. The finial atop the middle dome of the Jama Masjid was damaged in the storm.

The viral photo is being shared with the caption which translates to, "Yesterday, the 300 kg dome of Jama Masjid falling in the storm is no coincidence, "this is a clear sign from Mahadev" for him and for us.""

(In Hindi - कल आंधी में जामा मस्जिद का 300 किलो का गुम्बद व कलश गिरना कोई संयोग नहीं , " ये महादेव का स्पष्ट संकेत है " उनके लिए भी और हमारे लिए)
