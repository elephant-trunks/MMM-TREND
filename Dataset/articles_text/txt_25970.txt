A video showing Ex- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is going viral on social media, where he is being questioned about the corruption and social media users are claiming it as an actual footage Johnson being questioned on the accusations of corruption.

A user on twitter shared the viral video and suggested other countries as well as India to take a lesson. He writes, “*INVESTIGATION OF BORRIS JOHNSON – Ex. PRIME MINISTER OF UNITED KINGDOM* *CAN’T IMAGINE…. THIS HAPPENING IN INDIA or Somewhere else..* *Salute to Brave Police & Investigation Officers of UK* *Other countries & their investigation agencies must take a lesson from this?

Fact Check-

DFRAC firstly noticed the footage closely and found that it is showing questions filled with dramatic effects, including background music and highly dramatised shots.

Furthermore, we recognised the people conducting the questioning as British actors Vicky McClure, Martin Compston and Adrian Dunbar. All three actors are part of a television drama called Line of Duty.

We then searched for keywords ‘Line of Duty questioning boris johnson’ and found a video by The Guardian, which spoke about a similar mockery video made using actual footage of public appearances by Johnson, mixed with clips from Line of Duty by a satirical art group called Led by Donkeys.
