The India Meteorological Department has issued a nowcast warning of heavy rainfall in several parts of Maharashtra including Mumbai, Pune, Satara, Solapur, Sangli and Kolhapur districts.

The video has been captioned in Hindi as, "Playing with the sea waves at Mumbai's Bandra sea beach proved fatal for two women, as the hightide pulled them into the sea, claiming their lives."
