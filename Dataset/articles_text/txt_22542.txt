Amid protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens in parts of the country, a picture is going viral on social media of policemen holding posters against the government decisions.

India Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral picture is photoshopped. The original picture is of policemen protesting outside the Delhi Police headquarters after a clash with lawyers recently.
