A video showing a man in army uniform saving a small girl from being hit by a car, and then talking to a woman (who seems to be related to the girl) is widely circulated on social media.

The video is shared with the caption: “Salute to army”.

Here’s the link to the above post.

FACT CHECK

When NewsMobile fact-checked the video, it was found to be misleading.

On performing the Reverse Image Search, we found a longer version of the same video uploaded by 3RD EYE YouTube channel, on June 14, 2022.

The video description reads: “Disclaimer: Thank you for watching! Please be aware that this Channel features scripted dramas and parodies to aware people in different situations. This channel brings social awareness videos. These short films are for entertainment purposes only!”

The about section of the channel mentioned that they put out social awareness videos created for motivation and educational purposes.
