Spread the truth:

A video is viral showing a market area filled with water up to the waist, with a girl walking through and few men pushing a Scorpio car through it. The city is wrongly claimed as Delhi.

Twitter

Anuj Kumar Bajpai, a journalist with Zee Hindustan tweeted –

“ कितनी खूबसूरत है ये दिल्ली, कितनी खूबसूरत है यहाँ की सड़के क़ाबिले तारीफ है यहाँ की व्यवस्था, लाजवाब है यहाँ की सरकार “

Translation – “How beautiful is this Delhi, How beautiful are the roads. The administration is worth praising, awesome is the government”

This was a sarcastic tweet blaming Delhi government for such poor administration.

Truth

The video is from Rohtak, Haryana, not Delhi.

We came across many replies to the Anuj Bajpai’s tweet who told him that this is Huda Complex, Rohtak which gave us the clue to start looking further.

We looked at the video closely in one fourth of the original speed and noticed the shop names/ banners etc.

1. Huda Complex area does have a flyover as can be seen in the viral video

2. We noticed two shops on opposite sides of the fly over which are “Chopra Electricals and Standard “Standard Digital color Lab and Studio”

3. The registration number of the Scorpio Car being pushed through the water starts with “H” i.e. probably Haryana but not Delhi.

4. We talked to few owners of the shops in the video and they all confirmed our observations above , from their shop board colors to the name of the shops in opposite/nearby when asked to name.

5. This video has been uploaded on YouTube and other platforms yesterday claiming it as Huda Complex, Rohtak
