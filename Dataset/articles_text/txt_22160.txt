An image of a wrecked bus and some bodies lying alongside a stream is going viral on social media with the claim that 16 Amarnath pilgrims were killed after their bus fell into a nullah in Kashmir. Some security personnel can also be seen in the picture, which appears to be one of a rescue operation.

Among others, Facebook page “Prince Online Sumbal” posted the picture on July 18 and captioned it, “#Big Breaking At least 16 Amarnath yatras died. And many more injured as jksrtc pulgs in nalah”. Many users have written “good news” in the comment section.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the viral post to be misleading. The incident is true, but it is three years old. This year, the Amarnath yatra has not commenced yet.

The post is being widely shared on Facebook. The archived version can be seen here.

AFWA investigation

Using reverse search, we found the viral image in the photo gallery of “The Indian Express”. As per “The Indian Express”, 16 pilgrims were feared dead and over 30 injured after a bus carrying Amarnath yatris fell into a gorge in Jammu and Kashmir on July 16, 2017.

The bus accident took place in J&K’s Ramban district. The image was also used by “The Statesman” in an article with the same information.

This proves that the incident described in the viral post is three years old and not a recent one.

Status of Amarnath yatra 2020

The annual Amarnath yatra is likely to begin from July 21. As per reports, the J&K administration had said on July 4 that due to the spread of Covid-19, only 500 pilgrims would be allowed per day by road from Jammu to the holy cave shrine.

However, the commencement of the yatra is still uncertain after the J&K high court asked Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) to take a decision on holding the annual pilgrimage due to the threat of Covid-19. The holy shrine is managed by SASB.
