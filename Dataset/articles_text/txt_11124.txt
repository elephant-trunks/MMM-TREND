Fact Check-

We observed that several users have commented that the video is a part of a movie. Keeping this in mind, we broke the video into small key frames by using the InVid We Verify tool and a reverse image search along with keywords on Google. The results led us to a video published on YouTube on a channel named “Danish Association” on 29 December 2019. The headline of the movie states “The Taliban movie / The Clouds movie Abhara”. The feature film “Abhara” is also known as “Taliban” which is directed and scripted by Sediq Abedi.

The description of the video also mentions that the story of the film depicts the crimes of the Taliban from Kabul to the borders of Afghanistan in the Amu Darya.

The video duration is 1 hour 30 minutes where we can see the part in the viral video from 47 minutes 10 seconds.

We searched for Sediq Abedi on Google and found he is an Afghani filmmaker, who made several movies talking about the situation in Afghanistan. The list of his movies includes “Printer”, “Homelessness”, “Rebellion” and “A Man Dreaming of a Fifth Wife”. His movie, ‘A Man’s Desire for A Fifth Wife’ was shown at the International Film Festival of India.

Below one can see the image comparison between the screengrab of the movie and the screengrab of the viral video, which clearly shows that the viral video was picked up from the scenes of the movie published in 2019.

#Thread🚨- Post the #Taliban took control over #Afghanistan and it's capital #Kabul, @FactCrescendo has witnessed a rise in misinformation related to this event. Several unrelated images and videos are being shared online as footages of the country post the takeover. — Fact Crescendo (@FactCrescendo) August 19, 2021

Conclusion-

Fact Crescendo found the claim made along with the video to be False. A part of a movie clip has been falsely shared on social media claiming to show the current situation in Panjshir, Afghanistan where the Taliban can be seen detaining prisoners. The video is not a real incident.
