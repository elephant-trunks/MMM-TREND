Amid the faceoff between Russia and Ukraine, a video of hundreds of paratroopers landing from the sky has gone viral on social media. Several people shared this video with the claim that this video showed Russian troops landing in Ukraine.

“Russian Army Landed in Ukraine by parachutes,” said one Twitter user while sharing this video. Numerous other Facebook users shared the same video along with captions that claimed these were Russian Paratroopers landing in Ukraine.

This video was even shared by news outlets like Zee News, News24, and TV9 Bangla.

Archived versions of some similar claims can be found here and here.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found this claim to be misleading. The video shared is an old one and has often made the rounds on social media. It has no connection whatsoever with the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

We first searched with relevant keywords to get verified information regarding the Russian Army landing via parachutes in Ukraine. But there were no trustworthy sources that suggested that this massive group of paratroopers had landed in Ukraine.

With the help of the InVid tool and reverse image searches on Yandex, we found the same video uploaded to a website in 2019.

We then visited Google Russia and searched keywords in Russian related to the army and paratroopers while narrowing the search to just 2022. We found nothing relevant there either.

We, however, did find a tweet from September 4, 2016, that carried the same video. The text of the tweet in Russian said, “Remember, this is how Russian paratroopers look like.”

We, however, were unable to find the source of the video or any context surrounding it. But given that it was shared on social media as early as 2016, it is clear that it has nothing to do with the current Russia-Ukraine conflict.
