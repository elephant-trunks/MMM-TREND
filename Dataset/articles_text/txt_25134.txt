Tripura’s Chief Minister Biplap Deb tweeted French Polynesia’s picture to wish goa on statehood day. The picture included text and a graphic of Bora Bora islands with seaside shacks and a hill in the background. This post was curated for residents of Goa to wish them on their big day.

While he wrote quite enough on the picture itself, he also added a caption to it which read “Greetings to the beloved people of #Goa on their statehood day. May the state prosper more.”

In the tweet, two more twitter handles got tagged who further retweeted them as a mark of respect and celebration. Both these twitter handles are of Goa’s CM Pramod Sawant. One is his personal account and the other is the official account for Goa’s current Chief Minister.
