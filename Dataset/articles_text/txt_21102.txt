In a horrific incident, eight people were charred to death after their houses were set on fire in West Bengal's Birbhum district on the night of March 21. The violence erupted hours after a local Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader in Bogtui village was murdered. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has taken over the investigation of the killings that included children among the victims.

An image showing a vehicle set on fire and people injured sitting by the side of it is now circulated on social media as a sight from the violence that erupted after the killing of TMC leader in Birbhum.

The archived version of the post can be seen here.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim along with the image is misleading. This image is from the violence that broke out during the 2018 Panchayat elections in West Bengal.

AFWA probe

We did a reverse search of the image in question and found the same image carried by multiple media reports with credits to PTI in 2018.

As per these reports the image is from the violence that took place during panchayat polls in Nadia district of West Bengal in 2018.

In May 2018, at least 12 people had died and several got injured in the violence that erupted during the elections to about 40,000 panchayat seats in the state. As per reports, political violence was reported in at least four districts during the elections. Polling booths were attacked and ballot boxes were destroyed.

The opposition parties in West Bengal had slammed the State Election Commission and Trinamool Congress for the violence.

A video report about the clashes published by India Today in May 2018 can be seen below.

It is hence clear that the image in question is almost four years old and not related to the recent violence in West Bengal’s Birbhum district.
