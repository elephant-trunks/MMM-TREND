A message citing sources from Home Ministry is being shared on social media platforms claiming that Delhi NCR is going to be under complete lockdown from 18 June 2020, for a duration of 4 weeks. The message also states that Delhi will be under President’s rule. As the message went viral the Press Information Bureau (PIB) through multiple tweets has clarified that the message in circulation about the lockdown is fake, and requested everyone to be aware of such false rumours. These tweets can be seen here and here. The Spokesperson, Ministry of Home Affairs has also retweeted the same message. Hence it is clear that as of today, Delhi is neither under complete lockdown nor under President’s rule from 18 June 2020.
