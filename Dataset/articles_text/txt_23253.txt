Recently, BJP’s regional heads and state wings have been posting a spree of image-based messages on Twitter and Facebook showcasing their achievements in the last five years under the series “5 Year Challenge”.

But unknowingly BJP Chhattisgarh and BJP’s Karnataka Twitter images are misleading or wrong and used to show the positive side of the development.

Here is our #5YearChallenge. Western Peripheral Expressway, providing world-class infrastructure, became operational in a time-bound deadline. pic.twitter.com/cZrz2GHyFU — BJP Chhattisgarh (@BJP4CGState) January 18, 2019

In this Twitter message, BJP Chhattisgarh unit has shown a barren land on one side and another picture claiming its completion and stating that it was the Western Peripheral Expressway built under the Modi government. But actually, both pictures are not true as claimed.

Google Reverse image throws up the following original pictures:

The left side image was of the Lucknow-Agra Expressway that was under construction when the photographer took the picture on March 17, 2015. The Lucknow-Agra Expressway was inaugurated by Akhilesh Yadav in 2016.

The second picture was actually that of Delhi-Meerut Expressway, part of which has been opened up after inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May 2018. It was then tweeted by Union Minister Vijay Goel as shown below:

Faster than faster, in the path of #NewIndia under the dynamic leadership of PM Sh. @narendramodi the nation prospers! Glimpses from the Delhi-Meerut Expressway that will be dedicated to the public tomorrow by Hon’ble PM. #SaafNiyatSahiVikas #4YearsOfModiGovt #TransformingIndia pic.twitter.com/qOecJw49OW — Vijay Goel (@VijayGoelBJP) May 26, 2018

Conclusion:

The 5-year Challenge campaign of BJP has used wrong pictures claiming that it was the Lucknow-Agra Expressway. Our rating of the news is ?? (Misinterpretation).
