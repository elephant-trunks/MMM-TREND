Failure in examinations led to 2,413 suicides by students in 2016--or seven every day--accounting for 25% of student suicides. Over 23,000 student suicide deaths in India (30%) have been attributed to failure in examinations between 2007 and 2016.

India has one of the world's highest suicide rates for youth aged 15 to 29, according to a 2012 Lancet report, IndiaSpend reported on April 6, 2017.

"The popular perception is that failing exams or inability to cope with academics is the primary reason for student suicides," Shaibya Saldanha, co-Founder of Enfold India, an NGO which works with children and adolescents, had told IndiaSpend. "This is rooted in a sense of helplessness or extreme frustration."
