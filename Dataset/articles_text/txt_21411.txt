A set of two stunning images from a seaside, purportedly of a fulgurite, is viral on social media. “When Lightning Strikes Sand. It’s called fulgurite,” reads the caption of one such post on Facebook.

Fulgurite is natural silica-rich glass formed when lightning strikes slightly wet sand or bare rock. They are commonly less than three centimetres and cylindrical.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim, along with the images, to be misleading. These are images of a sandcastle created by academic and artist Matt Kaliner.

AFWA PROBE

Reverse-searching the images, we found that they were carried by multiple websites in 2015. According to these websites, the photographs show a sandcastle created by Matt Kaliner, a sociology lecturer at Wellesley College in the United States. He’s also an architect.

Beautiful images of sandcastles, including the viral ones created by Kaliner, were carried by 'The Atlantic' in a report published in August 2015. Kaliner has made such sandcastles on beaches around Boston, Puerto Rico and Mexico.

“I am motivated entirely by the sheer joy of playing on the beach, and making something out of what I can find that day,” Kaliner was quoted by “The Atlantic” as saying. Kaliner began the practice more than a decade ago and his work started gaining public attention after he started posting it on Flickr.

In an interview with Boston University radio that features his sandcastles, Kaliner had explained that his sandcastles are made from driftwood, a bit of string and dripped sand. “The principle is you use anything you find on the beach,” he’d added in the interview.

Images of some natural fulgurite can be seen below.

Hence, it is clear that the images in question are not natural fulgurites, but sandcastles created by a US-based artist.
