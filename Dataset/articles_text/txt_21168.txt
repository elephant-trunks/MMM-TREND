Amid the ongoing assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Manipur, a video of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has gone viral where he can be seen addressing a rally and saying, “Divide and loot."

The video was tweeted with claims like, “Just like the British Empire, Modi ji is teaching his party’s leaders and workers to ‘divide and loot’. The British may have left, but their treacherous descendants remain.”

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the viral video was clipped. In the full unedited video, PM Modi was accusing the Congress party of dividing people and looting them.

AFWA PROBE

With the help of InVid and reverse searches, we found the original video shared by the verified Twitter account of Narendra Modi on February 11, 2022.

The caption of the video in Hindi translates to: “Not just in Uttarakhand, Congress’ policy in the whole country has been to divide and loot”.

As Modi had specifically used the word “Uttarakhand”, we took it as a clue and conducted a keyword search to find out the exact date and location of this speech.

We found the full video of this programme shared on the verified YouTube channel of Narendra Modi. The caption of the video stated: “PM Modi addresses Vijay Sankalp Sabha in Almora, Uttarakhand.” It was streamed live on February 11, 2022.

At the 15.28-minute mark in this video, one can hear Modi saying, “Not just in Uttarakhand, Congress’ policy in the whole country has been to divide and loot.”

Hence, we can conclude that the claim along with this video is misleading. A portion of the full speech where Modi was talking about the Congress party’s supposed “divide and loot” policy was clipped and shared out of context.
