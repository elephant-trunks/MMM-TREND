This video was shared a lot and was views by almost 90,000 users across twitter.

Fact Check:

After going through the fact check analysis by our team, we got to know that this video is misleading. This video is not from Kashmir but from Faridabad on the outskirts of Delhi on 6th December, 2021. The victim and the accused are all Hindus and the incident happened over personal rivalry.

India Today and Times Now Hindi also reported this incident on December 6th. As mentioned in the official press release of Haryana police, this attack was in revenge.

Therefore, it clearly states that the video is not from Kashmir but Faridabad and Pakistani accounts like QurbanAly4 share such videos to spread communal hatred and violence. Thus, we can say that this claim of him is misleading.
