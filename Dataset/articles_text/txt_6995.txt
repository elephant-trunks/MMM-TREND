Kanpur recently witnessed violence on June 3, following controversial remarks made by a former BJP spokesperson, Nupur Sharma on the Prophet Muhammad. Police resorted to lathicharge to control the crowd.

Now, a video of cops lathi-charging people has gone viral. Many on Facebook shared it claiming the police lathicharge was from the recent Kanpur incident.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the viral video is neither recent nor from Kanpur. It is from a 2019 anti-CAA protest in Gorakhpur.

A reverse search of some keyframes of the video led us to the same video shared by the Facebook page of MMIS - Majlis E Mohammadi Islamic Samiti Official on December 20, 2019. It said the incident was in Gorakhpur.

Subsequent searches led us to a video report by Live Hindustan from December 20, 2019. Per this news report, after Friday namaz, people gathered to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at Nakhash Chowk, Gorakhpur. There was stone-pelting during the protest and subsequently, the police dispersed the crowd by charging with batons and firing tear gas shells.

The exact portion of the viral video can be seen after the 1.10-minute mark in the YouTube video.

During the anti-CAA protests in 2019, several parts of Uttar Pradesh witnessed violence and police lathicharge. The viral video from Gorakhpur alongside other incidents from different parts of UP was also reported by The Lallantop, which can be seen here.

Per reports, at least a dozen people, including two police officials were injured in the violence that broke out in Kanpur on June 3. Eighteen people have reportedly been arrested in connection with the violence.

Thus, it is clear that although the UP police had resorted to lathicharge in Kanpur to control the crowd, the viral video in question has nothing to do with it. The video is from 2019 and was shot during an anti-CAA protest in Gorakhpur.
