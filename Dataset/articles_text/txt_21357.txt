Several organisations across the world, including India, have made Covid vaccination mandatory for their employees.

In this context, a video is being shared on social media with the claim that it shows a man pushing a pie into the face of an airline CEO because he made Covid vaccination mandatory for all his employees.

The caption to the video reads, "A man casually walks on stage and puts a pie into the face of a airline CEO who mandated #Covid vaccines for his employees."

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim along with the video is misleading. This video is from 2017, years before the breakout of the novel coronavirus.

With the help of a keyword search, we found the same video carried by multiple news reports in 2017. This confirmed that the incident is old and not related to the pandemic.

On May 9, 2017, the same video was tweeted by CNN with the caption, "Watch this airline CEO get a cream pie rubbed in his face while giving a speech at a business event."

According to the CNN report, the man getting attacked in the video is Alan Joyce, the CEO of Australian carrier Qantas. He was attacked by Tony Overheu, 67, while speaking at a leaders’ summit organized by The West Australian newspaper in Perth.

According to a report by The Guardian, published on July 7, 2017, the man attacked Joyce for supporting same-sex marriage. The man was later fined by a magistrate court.

The incident was also reported by Business Insider, NBC News and The Independent.

It is hence clear that the video in question is more than four years old and not related to the pandemic or Covid vaccination.
