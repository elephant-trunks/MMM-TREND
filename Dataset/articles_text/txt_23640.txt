As many as 82% urban Indian households had a sanitary latrine, according to a new government study.

Of 16 states and union territories analysed, Kerala topped the list: 99% of households were equipped with a “sanitary latrine”--jargon for a proper toilet where that allows ‘safe disposal of human waste’--while West Bengal (51.6%) brought up the bottom.

Information on sanitary latrines was part of the socioeconomic survey of 52,577 households for 2017 the ‘Diet and Nutritional Status of Urban Population’ study conducted by National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau.

Five other states that did worse than average were Tamil Nadu (80.3%) Madhya Pradesh (80%), Maharashtra (75.2%), New Delhi (70.4%) and Uttar Pradesh (69.8%).

However, 88.8% of urban households have sanitary toilets, said the 2017 Swachhata Status report released in April 2017.
