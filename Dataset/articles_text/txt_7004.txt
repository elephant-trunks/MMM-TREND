The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned Congress president Sonia Gandhi and MP Rahul Gandhi to appear before it on June 8 in connection with the National Herald money laundering case.

Amid this development, a video clip has gone viral on social media as the Congress leader's reaction to the ED's move. “I am the daughter-in-law of Indira Gandhi. I am not scared of anyone”, Sonia Gandhi is heard saying in Hindi in the video.

Multiple Facebook users have posted this video clip alongside a Hindi caption that translates to, “When the police come to catch a loafer who steals in the streets, he says that my uncle is an MLA or minister. Just like that, when the ED calls Sonia for interrogation on stealing from the government treasury, Sonia says, I am Indra's daughter-in-law”.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that while the ED has summoned Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, this viral video is from 2015. It shows what Sonia Gandhi had said after a Delhi court asked them to appear in the National Herald case.

Relevant searches using keywords on Google led us to several articles and news clips published by the mainstream media in 2015. A news bulletin uploaded on the YouTube channel of India Today in December 2015 showed the exact reaction of Sonia Gandhi that has gone viral now.

The same video was uploaded on the news portal of “The Hindu” around the same time.

“NDTV” and “The Times Of India” had also published news reports on Sonia Gandhi’s comments.

Per these reports, Sonia Gandhi had said this in 2015 after a trial court in Delhi asked her and Rahul Gandhi, along with five others to appear in the National Herald case. The petitioner Subramanian Swamy had accused the Congress leaders of cheating in court.

Hence, it is clear that Sonia Gandhi’s comment about being Indira Gandhi's daughter-in-law was not made recently after being summoned by the ED. The viral clip is seven years old.
