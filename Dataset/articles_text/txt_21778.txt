A short clip of Sharad Pawar getting slapped by a man in public is circulating on social media after Pawar had asked Tendulkar to “exercise caution while speaking about any other field”.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the incident took place in Delhi on November 24, 2011. Pawar, then the Union agriculture minister, was slapped by one Arvinder Singh over rising prices of essential commodities.
