An emotional video of an apparent soldier saying goodbye to his family amid heavy gunfire is circulating on social media. The man records a message saying he might not be able to return home and asks his brother to take care of their mother.

“Soldier says goodbye to the family during the war,” reads the accompanying caption. One Twitter user said that the video is of an Iraqi soldier fighting ISIS.
