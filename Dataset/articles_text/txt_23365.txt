India recorded its one billionth vaccine dose on October 21, 2021. Citing this feat, Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare quoted Union Power Minister Raj K Singh as saying that India became the first country in the world to administer 100 crore vaccine doses.



"India becomes the first country in the world to administer 100 Cr #COVID vaccine doses under the leadership of Shri @narendramodi ji. My gratitude to our frontline workers, doctors, nurses, & scientists - Union Power Minister Shri @RajKSinghIndia," read the tweet from the ministry's official handle.

Singh Misquoted

In the video linked in the tweet, Singh never said India was the "first country in the world" to administer 100 crore doses. In fact, Singh begins the video by saying, "Our country has achieved yet another grand milestone by administering 100 crore COVID-19 vaccine doses" and then he goes on to congratulate the frontline workers for the achievement.

So, Singh has been misquoted in the tweet that has been archived here .

India's vaccination efforts kickstarted on January 16, 2021 and as of 5:55 pm on October 21, 2021, India had administered a total of 1,00,57,42,472 doses. Of these, more than 71,02,98,755 were first doses and 29,45,91,727 second doses.

India Not the First

India is not the first country in the world to administer one billion vaccine doses. China administered its billionth vaccine dose on June 19, 2021, which was over four months ago, according to data provided by Our World in Data (OWD), which sources data from COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. In fact, China even crossed the 2-billion mark on August 26, 2021.

By October 20, 2021, China had administered more than 223 crore vaccine doses, showed data collated by OWD.

FactChecker tried contacting Manisha Verma, Additional Director General (Media & Communications), Department of Health & Family Welfare, via text and email and Singh for clarification on the matter but had not received a response by the time this article was published. This story will be updated as and when we get a response.
