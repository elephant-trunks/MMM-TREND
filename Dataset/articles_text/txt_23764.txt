The “key initiatives” claimed by the Ministry of Rural Development, one year after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took charge, includes renaming an existing scheme, a 37% cut in funds for skill programmes and a 62% decline in rural candidates placed during the past one year.

We emailed our findings to the ministry last week, requesting comment. There was no response.

1. Deen Dayal Upadhyay Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY): Old scheme, new name

Claim: DDU-GKY launched in September 2014 to train rural youth for jobs

Check Revealed: The placement-linked skills (known as Aajeevika skills) scheme of the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) was renamed DDU-GKY on September 25, 2014. DDU-GKY is not a new scheme but the new name of an existing scheme.

2. Outlay for skill development and self-employment programmes cut by 37%

Claim: Projects to reach 0.8 million youth at a cost of Rs 2,682 crore approved.

Check Revealed: The previous government, under the 12th Plan, approved an outlay of Rs 29,006 crore for NRLM with an aim to skill 5 million rural youths, now known as DDU-GKY.

Since May 2013, 25% of NRLM funds have been set aside for the skills and placement project (or DDU-GKY scheme).

The annual plan outlay for the skills programme, which till 2012-13 was known as Swarna Jayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY), has been increasing since 2005-06. However, there is a significant decrease in allocation in the 2015-16 Budget.

3. 86,120 candidates trained and employed--true, but this is the least in two years

"text-align: justify;">86,120 trained during 2014-15, of whom 52,286 got jobs.

Check Revealed: Between 2004-05 and January 10, 2014, 920,101 candidates were trained and 729,547 got jobs. Fewer candidates were trained during 2014-15 compared to the previous two years.

4. Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY): Similar to older scheme

Claim: SAGY launched; MPs to develop a model village.

Check Revealed: A similar scheme of developing model villages had been launched some time back.

A pilot scheme, “Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana” (PMAGY), meant to develop 1,000 villages with a mostly scheduled caste (SC) population in Bihar, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Assam over three years was launched during FY 2009-10.

The objective of PMAGY was to ensure:

(i) physical and social infrastructure for socio-economic development.

(ii) removal of disparities between scheduled caste and non-scheduled-caste populations (literacy rate, completion of elementary education, infant mortality /maternal mortality, ownership of productive assets etc) and:

a. raising all below-poverty-line (BPL) families, especially those belonging to SCs, above the poverty line and providing them secure jobs.

b. ensuring all children complete at least eight years of education.

c. eliminate malnutrition, especially among children and women; and

(iii) eliminate untouchability, discrimination, segregation, and atrocities against SCs and discrimination against girls/women.
