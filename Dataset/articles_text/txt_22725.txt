After the central government’s decision to remove Article 370 which deals with special status to Jammu and Kashmir, many dubious posts relating to the state are being shared on social media.

A video has gone viral on Facebook with the claim that Indian Army burnt down houses of Kashmiris in Bandipora district of J&K. The video shows some houses on fire and people’s screams can be heard in the background.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that neither is the video from Bandipora, nor did the Indian Army burn down the houses. It was a year-old incident when four residential houses caught fire in Lachipora village of Baramulla in J&K.

The video was shared by Facebook page Free Indian Occupied Kashmir’ late on Monday night. Indian Army Burns Kashmiri People’s Houses In Bandi Pura indian occupied Kashmir and world is sleeping, it claimed along with the video.

The post has already been shared over 3,700 times till the filing of this story. The misleading post went viral last year too. At that time, it was shared more than 1,78,000 times.

Using In-Vid tool, we reverse searched the video and found some news reports from Kashmir which had details about the incident.

According to Rising Kashmir and Kashmir Observer, four residential houses and a cowshed in Lachipora village were destroyed in a blaze on March 27, 2018.

It was reported that at least 20 animals had died in the incident and seven families were affected. According to news reports, police could not ascertain the cause of fire. We did not find any news report claiming that Indian Army was responsible for the incident.

Last year, Alt News had also debunked the claim as fake.
