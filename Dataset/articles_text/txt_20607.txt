A screenshot of an alleged tweet by journalist Ajit Anjum is going viral on social media. It was stated that if CM Yogi Adityanath returns to power in 2022, he will leave journalism.

Fact Check

On checking the viral screenshot, we found it to be fake.

Actually, in the screenshot, Ajit Anjum’s Twitter account was said to be verified with a blue tick. Whereas in reality, it is not so.

Along with this, Ajit Anjum also tweeted and informed about this screenshot being fake. He wrote, मेरे बारे में दुष्प्रचार का नया फोटोशॉप. मेरे नाम से कुछ भी लिखकर वायरल किया जा रहा है. इसी से पता चलता है कि भक्तों की जमात मुझ पर कितनी बौखलाई हुई है. मेरा ट्वीटर हैंडल वेरिफाइड नहीं है लेकिन ब्लू टिक वाला फोटोशॉप करके खेल चालू है. ये फर्जी लोग हैं.

Which roughly states “new propaganda about me. Anything written in my name is going viral. This shows how furious the community of devotees is on me. My twitter handle is not verified but the game is on by photoshopping the blue tick. This is a fake tweet.”

Conclusion

With the research and Ajit Anjum himself coming forward it is clear that the viral screenshot is fake.
