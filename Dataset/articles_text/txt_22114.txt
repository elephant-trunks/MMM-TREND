With the help of reverse image search, we found they were carried by several news websites three years back. “The Sun” and “Daily Mail” published reports on August 3, 2017, along with these and more pictures.

As per these reports, Syrian refugees were humiliated and beaten by the Turkish army as they tried to cross the border. As per Daily Mail, “Images published on social media shows three men, reportedly Syrian refugees, all wearing brightly coloured women’s underwear with visible bruising and lacerations on their arms and backs.”

According to “The Sun”, the incident took place at the border in Hatay, southern Turkey.

Hence, the viral claim along with the images saying ISIS terrorists were wearing lingerie to carry them to heaven for 72 virgins is not true.
