An image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going viral on social media sites. The image is edited with the half face of Hitler with half face of Modi.

People on the internet are claiming that the image is published in TIME magazine cover page.

A user on Twitter writes, “Modi is a PM with no vision, no intellect & absolutely no desire to uplift the needy of the nation. All he has is, hunger to power! #ByeByeModi.”

Fact Check:

We at DFRAC reverse searched the image to check the reality of the image.

We visited the time magazine site and found no such cover on it.

On searching more on this site we found an article on the TIME magazine with the headline, “Can the World’s Largest Democracy Endure another Five Years of a Modi Government?”

Conclusion:

It is clear after going through the site of TIME magazine, no cover which is half face of modi and half of Hitler was found. Hence the image is fake.

Claim Review: The image going viral is edited with the half face of Hitler with half face of Modi is on cover of TIME magazine.
