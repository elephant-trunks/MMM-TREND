An image of a young boy holding a baby in his arms is going viral on social media sites. Further, users are sharing the picture with the caption, “WE STAND FOR PALESTINE”.

Similarly, many users are sharing the same picture.

Fact Check

On reverse image search we found the same picture on nbcnews. Further, the caption of the picture is, “A boy holds his sister who was saved from under rubble on Feb.14, 2014.”

The title of the news was war on Children. The report was published on 2016. Moreover, the report was about Syrian war not Palestine.

Hence, users are sharing an old image of Syrian Kids with misleading claim.
