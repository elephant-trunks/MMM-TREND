Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, while addressing a gathering in Bijnor last week, claimed that no riots had occurred in the state in the past five years. But, that's not true.

"There was a time when Uttar Pradesh was known for riots… On the basis of the recently released NCRB report, it has been observed that no riots have occurred in the state in the past five years, UP has become danga-mukt (riot-free)," he was quoted as saying by The Indian Express . According to Asian News International (ANI), the CM also said no 'communal riots' took place under his regime.

FactChecker looked at National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) Crime in India reports from the past five years to verify these claims. Fact-check According to latest NCRB data, Uttar Pradesh saw 35,040 cases of rioting during 2017-2021, which refutes Yogi's claim. Although 5,302 riots were reported in 2021 itself, it has reduced by 41% from 8,990 in 2017. In the past five years, the number of people who fell victim to these riots also dipped by 49% to 5,846 in 2021.
