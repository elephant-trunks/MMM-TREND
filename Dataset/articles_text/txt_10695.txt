A post is going viral on social media claiming that the Ministry of Education in India is providing free laptops to all students as part of a Government scheme with a link to a website to check if the individual is eligible for a laptop. Newschecker found these claims to be untrue.

The post shared on Facebook by a page called Anbiyam Tube which claims to be based out of Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The post reads ‘URGENT, Government giving FREE laptop💻 to all the students of india. Register your name on Gov-Laptops Site to get FREE laptop now. Further, it provides a link and ask people to click on it to check their “eligibility” for the scheme.
