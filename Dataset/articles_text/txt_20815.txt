Viral Video was also posted by BJP leader Kirit Somaiya from his Twitter handle on 27 May 2021. He also wrote that the BJP leader is being beaten up by the police. This incident should be investigated. After which an inquiry was ordered into the incident.

This investigation proves that the claims being made on social media are false and misleading. This video is not from UP but from Maharashtra and the youth who is being beaten up has nothing to do with celebrating Pakistan’s victory.
