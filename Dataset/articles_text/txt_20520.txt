After digging further, we got the full video of the Parliamentary session on YouTube. The video is of the speech given by Shah Mehmood Qureshi in the parliament on 26th October, 2020. In the speech he accused the other politician for behaving likewise Modi or following his ideology. In the whole speech no such appreciation were given to Narendra Modi rather people were criticizing him.

Dunya News, posted the video and captioned it with, ‘Shah Mehmood Qureshi Speech in National Assembly | 26 October 2020 | Dunya News | HB1L’.

In fact, Dawn also covered the speech of foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi in the National Assembly over a resolution unanimously passed in the assembly on blasphemous sketches.

Conclusion: Therefore, the claim is misleading as no such slogans were raised in the favor of PM Modi in the National Assembly.

Claim review: slogans were raised in favor of PM Modi in the Parliamentary session of Pakistan.
