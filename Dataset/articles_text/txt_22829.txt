Did Congress president Rahul Gandhi, to some extent, compensate for his loss in Amethi by securing a "historical" win in Kerala's Wayanad?

It is being claimed by some people on social media that Rahul Gandhi won Wayanad by the highest number of votes in this election.

Facebook page I.T & Social Media Cell Congress posted a photo of Rahul, claiming that he won more than eight lakh votes, and it is the biggest win among 542 seats in the polls.

India Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false. Rahul is not even among the three leaders to have won with the highest margin in this election.

On Friday (May 24), I.T & Social Media Cell Congress posted the picture of Rahul along with the claim in Hindi that reads, "Congress President Rahul Gandhi Ji has won with record number of 8 lakh 54 thousand 297 votes. Biggest win among 542 seats."

However, this is not the official page of the Congress IT Cell.

Here is the archived version of the post.

The post was widely shared on Facebook. Another user Pranav Mahajan also shared the same post.
