Upon investigation of this video we found that two Mi-8/17 helicopters used by the Syrian Air Force were shot down during the Syrian Arab Army’s invasion of Idlib Governorate. The first helicopter was shot down over southern Idlib on 11 February and the second over western Aleppo on 14 February. Neither of the crew of the two helicopters survived.

Apart from this, we found another similar video by searching on YouTube. Which was posted by The Telegraph in its story.

Therefore, this video is false.
