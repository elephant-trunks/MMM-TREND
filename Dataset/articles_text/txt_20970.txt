In this detailed report, India Today’s Nalini Sharma explains the legal grounds behind the Delhi High Court’s decision to suspend the life sentence of former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in the Unnao rape case. The court ruled that Sengar did not fit the definition of a 'public servant' under the POCSO Act, rejecting the trial court's reliance on the Prevention of Corruption Act for this definition. Despite this relief, Sengar remains in jail due to a separate 10-year sentence for the custodial death of the survivor's father. The report also highlights that the CBI and the survivor, who recently met Rahul and Sonia Gandhi, will challenge this verdict in the Supreme Court.
