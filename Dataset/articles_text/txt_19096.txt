A set of two images are viral with claims that a Sikh protester who clashed with cops during the tractor rally on January 26, had later been seriously injured by the Delhi Police. The images show a Nihang protester brandishing a sword in front of a security personnel. The second image shows an elderly Sikh man with an injured face.

BOOM found that both the images are unrelated. While the first image shows a protester on January 26, the image of the injured farmer is from December, 2020.

The images are doing the rounds with the caption "Old man got a good beating; look at the change ". (Original caption in Hindi: बाबा जी की कम्बल ठुकाई ; क्या से क्या हो गए देखते देखते ; Before After )
