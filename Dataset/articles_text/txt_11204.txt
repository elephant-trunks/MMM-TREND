Fact Check-

We started our investigation by carefully observing the video and found that a stone had hit the glass window of BJP MP Locket Chatterjee’s car which led to the window glass breaking. On observing the clip we can clearly spotted the stone coming in which hits the car from outside breaking the window. We broke down the video into small frames where the stone can be clearly seen.

Below you can see a slow-motion version of the viral video where we can see the stone coming in from a distance towards the glass and breaking it.

Additionally, a clip tweeted by CNN News18 journalist Payal Metha, at the 31 seconds timestamp we can also spot the stone coming in, on slowing down the clip and pausing. The video is clearer than the viral video and the stone is clearly visible.
