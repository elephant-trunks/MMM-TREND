Remember the internet sensation ‘Kolaveri Di’- the viral song with nonsense lyrics sung by Tamil actor Dhanush, whose tune had captivated millions?

Now, a Coca-Cola commercial in the Turkish language with a familiar tune has gone viral on social media with the claim that 'Kolaveri Di' was a straight lift-up from this “old Turkish advertisement for Coca-Cola”.

Multiple Facebook and Twitter have posted this Turkish commercial and wrote in the caption, “The origin of Kolaveri. Old Turkish advertisement for Coca-Cola from which 'Kolaveri Di' song was picked up”.

While some users raised questions about the authenticity of the viral claim, some did believe that 'Kolaveri Di' song was a copy of the Turkish commercial.
