An undated image of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray with party leader Anand Dighe has been shared on social media misidentifying Dighe as recently sworn-in Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde.

Rebel Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde was sworn in as chief minister of Maharashtra and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Devendra Fadnavis as deputy chief minister on June 30, after an eight day long political crisis in the state. Former Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray resigned after the Supreme Court ordered for a floor test. The political turmoil of Maha Vikash Aghadi (MVA), a coalition of Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Indian National Congress, began after Shinde led other rebel Shiv Sena MLAs and camped in Surat and Guwahati. The image has been shared in this context.

The image has been shared on Facebook with a caption, "Balasaheb Thackeray is giving blessings and applying tilak on Eknath Shinde in an old photo."







(Original Text in Hindi: "एक पुरानी फोटो में बालासाहेब ठाकरे एकनाथ शिंदे का तिलक देकर आशीर्वाद देते हुए।")
