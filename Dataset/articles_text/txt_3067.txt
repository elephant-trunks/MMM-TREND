FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the post and found the claim to be misleading.

We ran a keyword search and found multiple media reports stating that the video is from Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. The Times of India published the same video on July 14, 2022, with the title, “Viral video: Bhopal auto-rickshaw driver’s rain dance has netizens smiling.”

Times Now also uploaded the same on YouTube with the caption, “This Auto Driver’s Dance In Bhopal Flood Water Is Breaking The Internet #shorts”

However, we also found several other reports claiming that the video is from Gujarat. The reports can be seen here and here. One of the reports identified the man as Naresh Sondarva, a resident of the Bharuch district in Gujarat.

On searching further with relevant keywords, we found that the video was also uploaded a Naresh Sondarva on Instagram on July 12, 2022.

In his video, he also tagged a page called incredible.bharuch.

Thus, based on the above information, it is clear that the viral video is NOT from Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh but Gujarat.
