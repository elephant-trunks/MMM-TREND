There was a couple in a car. The lady sprayed perfume on her body. The man next to her was smoking… causing an explosion! With the fire burning, and the door couldn’t be opened to escape, the two were charred to death; advised ladies/gents not to use perfume-spray inside the car when someone smoking or anywhere near fire-site, like, kitchen, havan, open-fire, etc..
