On November 6,2021, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor posted a photo on twitter of a truck. The back of the truck said “Please do not honk, the Modi Government is sleeping”.

The image got over 35,000 likes on Twitter alone.

We also found that the official handle of Congress posted the image in 2019.

Fact-Check:

Upon performing a reverse image search, we found that the image was first posted by a blog as far back as 2011. In the original image, it can be seen that this text does not exist and the image is morphed.

Since the image is morphed, this claim is fake.
