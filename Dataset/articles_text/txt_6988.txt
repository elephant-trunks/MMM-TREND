Beyond a well-publicised condemnation of remarks made by now-suspended BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma, have there been material consequences for Indians living in Qatar? One viral video seems to suggest so.

The video shows a large group of men standing outside a building. The claim alongside suggests the peninsular Arab country is deporting Hindus back to India in the wake of Sharma's controversial remarks on the Prophet Muhammad.

In the video, a man said that around 7,000 men were boarding a bus to buy tickets. He referred to the place as "Redco International".

AFWA found that this video was from March, well before this controversy came into existence, and was thus unrelated to it.

We searched for “Redco International” on YouTube. The same video was shared by the channel QN Qatar on March 29, confirming that it was unrelated to the recent row.

In March, the channel also published other videos of men in front of the same area. In another video, several men argued about their pending salaries with another man. We also found a video from March 26 where a man spoke to others in front of a building with the board “Redco International”. The description of the video reads, “Redco international company Qatar salary breaking news.”

We also found similar videos of protests against Redco International uploaded to Facebook in March.

While we couldn’t find any credible reports on Indians, particularly Hindus, getting fired by any of the Muslim-majority countries in the wake of Nupur Sharma’s remarks, we could conclude that this video was not related to the ongoing row.
