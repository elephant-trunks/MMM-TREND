Ahead of the elections in Uttar Pradesh. several social media posts have shared a song claiming that it had been “composed by Muslims” to trigger anti-Hindu sentiment among the people. The song could be heard in this 29-second long clip shared on Twitter on November 7.

The lyrics in Hindi translate as: “If Samajwadi Party is voted to power, the construction of Ram temple will cease. Muslim flags will fly and saffron flags will be brought down.” It was shared with the caption that said:”This song composed by Muslim community is an eye-opener for Hindus. We can see the truth of the Samajwadi Party. Even then some idiotic Hindus in the name of caste are dreaming to see Samajwadi in power.”
