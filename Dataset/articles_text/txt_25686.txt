A video of a man circumambulating the Kedarnath temple on his hands is widely shared on social media. The social media users claim that the man seen in the clip is Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he was 26 years old.

The video is shared on Facebook with a Hindi caption: “मोदी जी का 26 वर्ष की उम्र में केदारनाथ की परिक्रमा लगाते हुए। आपने कभी ऐसा भक्त देखा है जिसकी संपूर्ण भक्ति राष्ट्र के लिए समर्पित हो” (English translation: Modi Ji‘s circulation of Kedarnath at the age of 26. Have you ever seen such a devotee whose complete devotion is dedicated to the nation?)

Here’s the link to the above post.

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim, and found it to be MISLEADING.

Using the InVid Tool, we extracted keyframes from the viral video and performed a Reverse Image Search. This search directed us to a news report published by ETV Bharat on June 21, 2021, that carried the same viral video with a headline: “Teerth priest circumambulated Kedarnath temple by walking on his hands, know the reason.” The article nowhere mentions anything about PM Narendra Modi.

We then compared the viral video with ETV Bharat’s uploaded video, and found many similarities.

A similar video was also carried by India TV on June 21, 2020, with the description: “Kedarnath Dham temple priest Santosh Trivedi performed unique Yoga on the occasion of International Yoga Day”

Further, we did a keyword search, but could not find any credible media report that corroborated the viral claim. Had such an incident happened, it would have been covered by mainstream media.

Thus, it is evident from the above information that the viral claim is misleading.
