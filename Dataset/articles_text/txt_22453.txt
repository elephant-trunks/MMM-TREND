Amid a plethora of photos and videos related to the Delhi riots going viral, a recent image shows a policeman trying to hit a young boy with a baton. It is being claimed that this is how the Delhi Police tackle terror.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim with the photo to be misleading. This is a 10-year-old picture from Dhaka, Bangladesh.

One Anil Kumar Yadav posted this image along with the taunting caption: "Bahut bade aatank ko peette hue Delhi Police." This misleading post has already been shared more than 27,000 times. The archived version of the post can be seen here.

Many others have also posted this picture on Facebook and Twitter.

A simple reverse search revealed the truth behind the viral photo. The picture was used in an article of The Guardian in 2010. The caption with the photo says, "A Bangladeshi policeman appears to be about to hit a child during clashes with garment workers in Dhaka."

The picture was taken when textile workers in Dhaka were protesting over low wages and poor conditions of workers.

During this protest, the police in Bangladesh used bamboo staves, teargas and water cannon to disperse the workers. At that time, many children were also caught up in these clashes with the police in Dhaka.

We also found a picture on Getty Images with the same piece of information. The picture was taken on June 30, 2010.
