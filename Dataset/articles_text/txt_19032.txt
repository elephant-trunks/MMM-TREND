An old video showing a group of young men throwing buckets of water on a group of Muslim women wearing burqas, is being circulated on social media platforms with a false claim that it shows an incident that happened in India.

The video has been revived in the backdrop of the ongoing hijab row in Karnataka.

BOOM found that the claim is false. The video actually shows an old incident that happened in a Sri Lankan university and has no connection with India.

The Hindi caption with the video translates to, "Prime Minister Narendra Damodar Das Modi Ji, the country has become the India that you had imagined. I heard that politics is dirty but today entire India is watching the country is getting ruined due to the temptation of power!!".

(Original Caption in Hindi: प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र दामोदर दास मोदी जी आपने जिस भारत की कल्पना की थी अब ओ भारत बन चुका है राजनीति गंदी होती है ये सुना था पर सत्ता मोह में देश बर्बाद होते आज पूरा भारत देख रहा है !!)

The Tamil caption with the video said it was a ragging incident from Eastern University in Sri Lanka. The video was uploaded by an user named Mohamed Sarjoon.





BOOM also found the video on a YouTube channel named Now News stating that the incident was from Sri Lanka.

Lanka Sun News, a Facebook page, uploaded a video on February 24, 2019 stating that the video is that of a incident of ragging from Eastern University.
