A claim about veteran Bollywood actor Dharmendra Deol passing away, is being shared on social media.

Several actors, authors, sports players, and political figures have been the victims of online death hoaxes in the past.

However, we spoke to senior entertainment journalists and then dismissed the claim. We also found statements from Deol's children that said that he was keeping well and that the claim about his death was not true.
