The terrorist attack in Baramulla district of Kashmir on August 17 killed at least four security personnel two CRPF constables, one policeman and a soldier.

Soon after the attack, security forces gunned down three militants, including Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Sajad Haider in Kreeri area of Baramulla.

Now, a picture of what appears to be of a clash between security forces and protesters has gone viral on social media with the claim that stone-pelting started in Kreeri after the killing of three militants.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the viral post to be misleading. The photo is almost four years old, taken in August 2016, in Srinagar.

A Facebook page Awantipora news posted this image with a caption “Stone Pelting Starts at Kreeri After Killing of 3 Militants.” Some other Facebook users also shared the misleading post. Archive of the post can be seen here.

The viral photo shows a signature of one ‘Muzamil Matto’ and suggests that the photo was clicked in 2016. We found that Muzamil Mattoo is a freelance photojournalist in Kashmir who clicked this picture in August 2016 in Srinagar.

Muzamil Mattoo uploaded this picture on his Instagram profile on August 31, 2016. He captioned the image as “Protestors clash with Indian forces during pro-freedom demonstrations in Srinagar, Indian controlled Kashmir.”

India Today also reached out to Mattoo regarding the viral photo. Mattoo confirmed to us that he had clicked the picture in Batamaloo locality of Srinagar.

The photo is also available on stock photo website Alamy.

It proves that the photo was taken in 2016 and has nothing to do with the recent clashes in Baramulla. As of now, no major incident of stone-pelting has been reported from the valley after the encounter of three militants. However, India Today J&K correspondent Ashraf Wani did confirm that one or two minor incidents of stone-pelting took place in Kreeri after the encounter in Baramulla on Monday.
