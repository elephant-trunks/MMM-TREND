An image of a girl holding a placard in front of Taj Mahal is widely being shared on social media. The text on the placard reads: “Behind the beauty of Taj Mahal is plastic pollution”

The image is shared with a caption, claiming that the girl holding the placard is a foreign tourist.

The caption associated with the image reads:“भाजपा की सरकार में यमुना जी गंदगी से भरी पड़ी हैं , ताजमहल की खूबसूरती पर ये गंदगी एक बदनुमा दाग है , विदेशी पर्यटक द्वारा सरकार को आईना दिखाना बेहद शर्मनाक है , योगी जी को संज्ञान लेना चाहिए। (English translation: “Yamuna is full of filth under the BJP government… This filth is a stain on the beauty of Taj Mahal… It is very shameful for a foreign tourist to show the mirror to the government… Yogi ji should take cognizance”)

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile did the fact-check, and found it to be misleading.

On doing a Google Reverse Image Search, we found the same image was uploaded by a YouTube channel on June 27, 2022. The description of the video reads: ” Meet 10-year-old climate activist Licypriya Kangujam from Manipur. Her one tweet forced the Agra authorities to clean the garbage around Taj Mahal. Standing with a placard, Licypriya had highlighted the trash behind the Taj Mahal”

India Today had also uploaded a video on June 26, 2022, with a description: “After climate activist from Manipur Licipriya Kangujam shared a photograph showing plastic pollution near Taj Mahal, Agra officials took this step”

Licipriya Kangujam had also quote tweeted Samajwadi Party’s social media coordinator Manish Jagan Agrawal, refuting the claim that she is a foreigner. The Tweet reads: “Hello Sir, I’m a proud Indian. I’m not a foreigner”

Hence, we can ascertain that the viral claim is misleading.
