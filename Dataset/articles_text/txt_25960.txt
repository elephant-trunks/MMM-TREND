A similar claim was made by a user on Twitter.

Fact Check:

To investigate the reality of the video DFRAC heard the video and found that the language used in the video is not Malayalam, but Hindi which is not the most commonly used language in Kerala state.

We too looked for any news report of the above-mentioned incident that is claimed to have taken place from Anakkampoyil and Tusharagiri, but found no reports as such.

Then we reverse searched the image of the waterfall and found the same waterfall with the name Rautwadi Waterfall on Google which is located in Maharashtra.

We found a report related to the same waterfall proving the incident took place in Maharashtra and not Kerala stated by News18.

Conclusion:

Hence, the incident took place in Maharashtra and not Kerela as being by claimed by social media users.

Claim Review: Viral video of police beating the people bathing in the waterfall is from Anakkampoyil and Tusharagiri.
