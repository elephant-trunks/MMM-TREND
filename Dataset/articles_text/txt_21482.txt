Amid sickening reports of Taliban atrocities emerging from Afghanistan, a video of a man being stoned to death is circulating on social media with the claim that such are the horrors being perpetrated by the Islamist group.

"WARNING-EXTREMELY DISTURBING. To those who say the #Taliban have changed, watch this horrifying footage from #Afghanistan of a man being stoned to death. This is who the Biden administration is appeasing," reads one such caption along with the video.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral footage is from 2018 and shows a 60-year-old man being stoned to death by Islamic State terrorists.

Reverse-searching keyframes from the viral video, we found that several social media users had shared it in 2018. The Persian caption of one such post broadly translates to, "A 60-year-old man accused of rape was stoned to death in Afghanistan by Islamic State militants."

Getting some clue from here, we performed a keyword search in Persian language. This led us to news reports by several Persian media outlets about a 'stoning ceremony' conducted in Darzab district of Jowzjan province in Afghanistan. According to these reports, a 60-year-old man accused of rape was stoned to death here.

An eyewitness of the incident had told BBC that the man was from Mongol village of Darzab district. His body was buried without any prayers being recited. As per the BBC report, the incident took place around February 2018.

Therefore, it is evident that the viral video is neither recent nor related to the Taliban. It shows Islamic State terrorists stoning a man to death in 2018. The Taliban too is known to carry out such acts though.
