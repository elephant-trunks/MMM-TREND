Some pictures of people getting beatings by policemen and showing up their scars are getting viral on social media platforms. It is claimed that the students who were opposing the railway’s decision of holding RRB-NTPC exams in two-stage faced these atrocities.

The students are protesting because they think it is injustice for those who have appeared and cleared the first stage of RRB- NTPC exams for the computer-based test which was released on January 15. Various Protesters squatted on rail tracks at several places, hampering the train movement of the state to show their dissent.
