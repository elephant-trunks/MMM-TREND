Manipur Assembly Election will be held in March 2022. Narendra Modi has already stated that this polling will decide the next 25 years of Manipur. BJP’s work in the last 5 years will benefit Manipur for the next 25 years. Both BJP and Congress are conducting rallies in the state.

Meanwhile, a video of Rahul Gandhi is going viral where a user sarcastically quoted Rahul Gandhi’s word. In the video, he is heard speaking, “it was raining and that caused you trouble, Thank you.” The video was uploaded on 21st February 2022 by Jayesh.

Fact check

After looking further, we got the full video of Rahul Gandhi which is circulated on social media. The viral video is taken during his public meeting at Hapta Kangjeibung, Imphal. In his speech, he mentioned that the ruling party (BJP) comes with the air of superiority in Manipur whereas Congress respects the language and culture of the state. At the end of the speech, he politely mentioned that even though it was raining but you all came to the gathering, Thank you. Rahul Gandhi himself posted the video of his speech on Twitter. Therefore, the video is edited and misled by the users.
