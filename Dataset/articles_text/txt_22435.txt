A photograph of a billboard with a communal message is being widely shared on social media. It's being claimed that a signboard installed in Australia reads, "Interested in time travel? Convert to Islam to take you back 1,400 years!"

To verify this claim, India Today’s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) ran a reverse search on the image and found that it isn't a real picture of any signboard in Australia.

It was created through a billboard designer application called Makesweet. Click here to see the specimen for the hoarding.

We found several images on the Internet of the same display board, but with different messages.

You can see that the same yellow car is visible in each photographs.

We also used the app to make a billboard with the words "India Today Fact Check". You can check it out in this collage.
