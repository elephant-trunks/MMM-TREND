Truth

The photo is edited with Flag added on it digitally. The original photo is a decade old, Year 2010



The blog posted in 2010 published the same photo.

We have contacted the author of the article, Mr. Mubasshir Mushtaq, a freelance journalist. He claimed he himself took the photo and emailed us the original photo from which we found the photo was taken on 22nd June 2010 by Canon PowerShot S5 IS.

You can see complete EXIF data of the original photo here

The same photo has been used by few News houses 3 years ago, i.e. 2017.

You can see a comparison between the now viral photo and the original old photo below which proves that the viral photo is edited, not real.

You can see the same vehicles on same position, a man walking with bag in his hand. The red rectangle on top in viral image shows a light blue strip is added digitally to fit the flag.

The photo below is part of forensics of images and is an ELA (Error Level Analysis) of the viral image. Link of analysis

As shown in the red rectangle on the viral image above, you can see that it’s a flat color in the ELA screenshot below. The top part of the image is flat single color with flag on it. SO the original image was extended vertically (a light blue strip matching sky color) to fit the flag on it.

Further, the flag has been taken from a photo which only shows the blue sky.

Further, the viral image is old. The building behind the tower has been renovated, canopies on the roof changed, entire building has been painted white.

The Tribune posted an article 2 days ago and shows the building in white color too.
