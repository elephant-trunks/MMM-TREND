Days after the terror attacks rocked New Zealand and made global headlines, a Facebook page named Sajid Hashmat’ shared a video, claiming that 350 people have accepted Islam post-Christchurch attacks.

At least 50 people were killed in attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on March 15.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false as the video is more than 10 years old and it was shot in Germany.

The message with the video reads, 50 Muslims were killed on Friday in New Zealand & 350 people accepted #Islam today in #NewZealand."

At least a million had viewed the video and more than 64,000 shared it at the time of filing this article.

Another Facebook page Chhirottal Mustakeem’ also posted the same video with the comment, On Friday, 50 people died in New Zealand. Today, 350 people in New Zealand have converted to Islam.

The page further claims, Worldwide, non-Muslims criticise and hate Islam, falling victim to racism and sectarianism. But the citizens of New Zealand have accepted and represented the truthfulness of Islam as a religion. They have displayed that humanity comes first, and have demonstrated that there can be peace in New Zealand by accepting Islam as their religion. Nearly 350 New Zealanders assembled together and in the presence of a Muslim cleric, they willfully converted to Islam.

The 1-minute-30-second-long video shows a crowd present in a hall. One by one, they go through the process of converting to Islam.

The same video was also posted by Facebook pages Aalor Pothik’ and Vision of a Sia’.

AFWA did a reverse search of the video and discovered that it is an old video. It was first uploaded on YouTube on September 27, 2009.

We found the same video on a Russian web portal my.mail.ru uploaded on March 22 in 2011. On top of the video, it is written that some German youngsters are getting converted to Islam.
