This ORIGINAL interview clip exposes Vinod Dua’s

Propaganda U Tube video (paid news) against Shri Nitin Gadkari.

Please compare the two video clips Propaganda vs Reality.

Vinod Dua has doctored the interview to make it appear as if the stalled projects and NPA were in Ganga related projects and the fault was of the Modi Government.

Where as Shri Gadkari has clearly stated in the interview that all the stalled

Projects were road and highway projects caused by the UPA government.
