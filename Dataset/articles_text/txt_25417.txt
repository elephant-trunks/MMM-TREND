Spread the truth:

History rewritten by #FakeNews. Is that real photo of Tipu Sultan ? Did he Time Travel to future ?

For a long time this photo has been making rounds on social media claiming to be of real Tipu Sultan.

So is this a proof of Time Travel ?

As the records says, he died in 1799 when no camera was invented at all. So this could be his painting though but no proof anywhere. The man in photo could be anyone, some king from after invention of camera, or even a painting.

The first and oldest photograph discovered is from year 1826.

He should have traveled to 2017 and take selfies with our leaders 😉

Lie claiming Tipu Sultan’s real photo:

First Photograph ever taken:

This source below came out to be wrong too, Thanks to Altnews for correcting us.

The person in the photo is Rumaliza



1. The facial features are nearly identical. The nose is long and slender, and the ears are peculiarly shaped.

2. The robe worn by the persons in both pictures has the same design.

3. The dagger which can be seen tucked inside the robe in both pictures is identical.

In conclusion, the picture, circulated aggressively by social media users claiming it represents Tipu Sultan, is not the picture of Tippu Tip either, as inferred by media outlets. The picture instead closely resembles Rumaliza, another slave trader of Zanzibar, Tanzania.
