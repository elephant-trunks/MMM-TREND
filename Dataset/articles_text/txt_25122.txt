He tweeted – “Sonia Gandhi and her entire family’s China visit in 2008 is significant. Back then, she or any of her children weren’t holding any public office, then on what basis did they accept Chinese hospitality? Why is the family’s interest, from Doklam to Ladakh, above national interest?“

Many more used this photo recently which you can see at the end of this article

Three years ago, in July 2017 two TV channels used these photo for debate claiming these as ‘undated’ and ‘unverified’

We debunked this three years ago itself.

From our 3 year old article –

TV News channels, Times Now and Republic posts an ‘unverified’, ‘undated’ photo of Rahul Gandhi standing with Robert Vadera, Priyanka Gandhi with people from Chinese embassy with a doubt on the location and timing of the photo.

Republic and Times now ran programs that when and why this family meet Chinese envoy/officials, is there something wrong ? Times used word “Chakkar” while Republic claimed Vadra talked to ‘China’

Republic tweeted

“#VadraChinaTalks | Undated photo shows Vadra with Rahul and the Chinese envoy. What’s Vadra’s job with the Chinese envoy?”
