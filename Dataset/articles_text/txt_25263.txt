Spread the truth:

Photo of a coastal road is viral on Facebook with a misleading claims in Hindi –

“स्विट्जरलैंड नहीं बल्कि हिंदुस्तान के उत्तराखंड में चारधाम यात्रा करने के लिए बनाया फोर लेन मार्ग है, सच ही तो है, मोदी ने किया ही क्या है”



Translation: This is not Switzerland but is a four lane road made for Chardham yatra in India. It’s true, Modi did this.

ये उत्तराखंड के चार धाम जाने वाले मार्गो का नया और अद्भुत स्वरूप है! मोदी है तो मुमकिन है”. English translation:This is the new and wonderful form of Margo to the four dham of Uttarakhand! It is possible if Modi is there,”

Truth

First of all, you can see the vehicles are driving on right hand side lane, in India rule is to drive on the left which proves this claim false.

This obviously is a coastal road but no sea or ocean could be found in Char Dham area.

The city is Tangier, Morocco, Africa.

Name of the Road is “Route de la Plage Merkala”

You can see the similar images of the same spot taken over time by different people from slightly different angles.

This same viral photo was tweeted 4 years ago i.e. 2015 –

SMHoaxSlayer ran a google reverse image search . Reverse image search leads us to Pinterest where we find that the image is from Tangier , Morocco. After downloading the photo, we used google map to see the exact location .

Here is the link of an aerial view of Tangier by using google map https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Tangier,+Morocco/@35.7917839,-5.8246994,261a,35y,39.44t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0xd0b875cf04c132d:0x76bfc571bfb4e17a!8m2!3d35.7594651!4d-5.8339543

After analyzing the photo we saw that the lane the street lights are same with the image that went viral with a misleading claim.
