In this report, India Today Legal Editor Nalini Sharma details the Supreme Court's strong observations regarding the ongoing air pollution crisis in Delhi-NCR. The apex court has slammed the 'affluent class' for refusing to change their lifestyle, noting that it is 'ultimately the poorer people within the society that are suffering' as they lack access to luxuries like air purifiers. The Chief Justice of India (CJI) also expressed concern over outdoor sports activities in schools, suggesting they be halted or rescheduled as children are being exposed to hazardous air quality. The Court emphasized that clear directions must be enforced forcibly as states are failing to act on their own to mitigate the 'repetitive problem' of worsening AQI.
