TWITTER

A Twitter user then shared the screenshot and claimed that Rahul Gandhi was not only recognized on a National level, but also globally. The tweet was captioned, “Not only in India even in World. Rahul Gandhi recognized as a trustworthy leader, So India needs Rahul for developed India.”

TRUTH

There is no such news on BBC.

With reference to the date mentioned in the viral post, the keywords in the title were used to search Google within selected timeline of 11 January 2016 to 13 January 2016. The results had no mentions of the particular article by BBC that voted Rahul Gandhi as the third most trustworthy political leader in the world.

The website of BBC was also searched to find the particular false post from 2016. However, no results were yeilded.

If the viral post is closely examined, the Feature and Analysis column shows two articles namely The lost boy and Japan’s parenting debate and Looking into the massacres of Indonesia’s past. The articles shown in this snippet was published by BBC in June 2016. Besides, there’s also few stories under the section ‘Top Stories’. The same text is available on BBC’s website, with the same text but different headlines.

There’s a start contrast between the viral post and the articles on the BBC website that was published on 11 January 2016. The format used to write the date, month and year is different in both.

Again, the Gallup International Association (GIA), published annual reports in 2017 and 2018 wherein the organization conducted a survey and asked the audience to -‘indicate whether you have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable opinion of each of the following world leaders?’

The poll results however didn’t feature Rahul Gandhi in any of it’s reports. Thus, it is evident that a morphed screenshot of a BBC article was disseminated to falsely claim that Rahul Gandhi has been voted as the third most trust-worthy political leader in the world.
