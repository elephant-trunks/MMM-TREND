UP will witness its seventh phase of polling on March 7 starting with Jaunpur along with 54 other constituencies. UP election plays a pivotal role in ensuring the governance at central. Meanwhile, a claim is going viral on social media where a user is claiming that Jayant Chaudhary paid a visit to Mayawati at her residence. Niraj Kumar M. Niraj, a Facebook user posted a video of both the political leaders meeting on 16th February 2022 and wrote that this time BSP will come to Uttar Pradesh as RLD and BSP are allying.

Fact check

After cross-checking the authenticity of the video and viral claim, we got to know that the video is from March 2019. ANI UP/Uttarakhand posted the tweet inserting some pictures of Jayant Chaudhary and Mayawati’s meeting. The post was captioned by, “Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) leader Jayant Chaudhary meets Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati in Lucknow”. As we can see both the viral video and pictures are of the same meeting which took place in 2019. Therefore the viral claim is misleading.
