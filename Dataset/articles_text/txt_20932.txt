Fact-Check: With some analysis and reverse image searches we found out that this video of Rupani seemed to be a broadcast from ABP Asmita and it showed Rupani removing the red beacon from a car.

“Respecting Modi Govt’s historic decision of ending Lal Batti culture, removed Red Beacon from my car.” Read Vijay Rupani tweet which he himself posted on 20th April, 2020.

This clearly depicts that this claim is false which shows the former Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani removing the red beacon from his car following his resignation.
