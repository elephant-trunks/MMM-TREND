Fact Check

On keyword research, we found no such news. Further, we checked the official websites of BCCI as well as IPL but we found no such news. Moreover, there is no such announcement on the social media handle of BBCI president Saurav Ganguly and secretary Jay Shah. Therefore, there is no evidence from any credible source that BCCI has announced a new cap for the best all-rounder in the IPL.

Conclusion

It is highly unlikely that BCCI has made such a decision but had not announced it on any of its official platforms. Therefore, in our fact check analysis we found that this news is baseless. And, there is no such announcement of a mixed-colored cap to honor the best all-rounder in the IPL yet. Hence, the viral claim is fake.
