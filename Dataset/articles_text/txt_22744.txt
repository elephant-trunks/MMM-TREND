India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the incident has no connection with Iran and it was an unmanned Russian rocket.

The video has been viral since February 13 when a verified Facebook user Hananya Naftali shared it. The misleading post has already attracted more than 10,000 shares. People are trolling Iran, assuming the claim to be true. However, some of the social media users were correct in pointing out that it was a Russian rocket.

How we investigated

With the help of some keywords, we found that it’s a Russian Proton-M rocket which crashed in July 2013. As per the Euronews, it was an unmanned rocket carrying three navigation satellites. The rocket was launched from Russian-leased Baikonur launch facility based in Kazakhstan.

Russia’s space agency Roscosmo said the accident happened due to an emergency shutdown of the rocket’s engines. The reports said the estimated loss from the three satellites was about 154 million euros. However, no injuries were reported.

The incident was widely reported in international media too.

The conclusion

Hence, AFWA established that the rocket claimed to be of Iran actually belonged to Russia.
