On October 22,2021, Shefali Vaidya, a popular figure on conservative social media posted a screenshot of an article in response to Shiv Sena politician Priyanka Chaturvedi’s tweet. Chaturvedi had commented on the recent backlash on brand FabIndia’s controversy over their Diwali ad campaign. Users took to social media to express their anger of the words “Jash-e-Riwaaz” used to describe a ‘Hindu’ festival.

Chaturvedi commented on the need for corporations to stick to their words and not buckle under pressure.

In response to this Shefali Vaidya tweeted a screenshot of an article taking a jab at Shiv Sena.

Fact-Check:

We performed a keyword search on the issue and found a 2021 article on Karachi Bakery by Scroll that gave us an update about the issue. Karachi Bakery, Mumbai branch shut down in March 2021 due to financial losses. Until its closure, its name remained Karachi Bakery. The article also covered aspects of the controversy that was mentioned by Vaidya stating that Shiv Sena refused to back the demand of the Shiv Sena leader who approached the bakery.

The owner himself then clarified that the closure had nothing to do with name changing.

Vaidiya posted the screenshot of the article without fully verifying the facts. Neither did Karachi Bakery change their name and nor was the Shiv Sena leader supported by his party when he made the request. Therefore, this claim is misleading. Shefali Vaidya has a history of posting misleading and fake claims. You can read our reports on previous claims here and here.
