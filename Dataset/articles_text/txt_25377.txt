Spread the truth:

AAP’s Alka Lamba quotes a tweet with video of a minister dancing obscenely with a girl on stage claiming to be Madhya Pradesh Education Minister Kunwar Vijay Shah Minister.

The tweet she quoted

This Video actually is 2 years old of JDU MLA Abhay Kushwaha

And this is nothing new for JDU MLAs or rather with politicians.

Another such instance from Year 2010 i.e 7 years back
