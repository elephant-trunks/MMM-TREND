FactCheck

After doing keyword research, we found a video on facebook. Surprisingly, this is the same video, that got viral recently amid Russia -Ukraine crisis. But, the video was uploaded on 18th september, 2016. Further, the caption of the video was, “Massive air ‘desant’ of Russian VDV airborne troops (around 2000 paratroopers) in Rostov region from 17 Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft. Each Il-76 can take 126 paratroopers (‘desantnik’). Year 2014. ‘VDV’ or Russian Airborne Troops currently go through enlargement from 35 000 in 2014 to 72 000 by 2019. VDV is the strategic reserve of the Supreme commander and subordinate to the President of Russia. The only heavily mechanized airborne capable force in the world.”

Hence, it is not related to present day situation.

Conclusion

Therefore, the viral video showing hundreds of Russian paratroopers descending from fighter planes on the Ukrainian soil is fake and misleading.

Claim Review: Russian military paratroopers land in Ukraine, near Kharkov.
