A piece of news is getting viral on different social media platforms. In the time of Covid-19, many rumours were getting viral to defame a country, political leader or authorities. News from Nigeria (a country in West Africa) is in the air. Many users on social media are uploading a video where cartons are being dumped in vacant land. Users are claiming that the Nigerian Government has destroyed 1 million vaccines. Pieter Niblett on Twitter tweets, “BREAKING: Nigeria destroys over 1 million vaccines, these people are not stupid. Power to the people.”

Fact Check

A country will never destroy 1 million vaccines in crucial times like this. For clearing our doubts we cross-checked the report and saw a mere example of how a misunderstood news looks like. We got a tweet by Bloomberg Quicktake, who posted the tweet on 25th December 2021. The tweet says, “Nigerian authorities destroyed 1,066,214 expired doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The country says it will no longer accept donated Covid vaccines with short shelf lives from Western nations”

A report of Barron’s explains the same how Nigeria destroyed 1 million Jabs due to the expiry of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Hence proving the claim is misleading and fake as the Nigerian Government destroyed expired dosses of AstraZeneca Vaccine.

Claim Review: Did Nigeria destroy 1 million doses of Vaccine
