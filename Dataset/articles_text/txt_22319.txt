India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral picture is photoshopped. The original crop circle was created in a wheat field in Wiltshire, England, in 2004.

We also found other images of the crop circle (https://temporarytemples.co.uk/crop-circles/2004-2) from different angles.

For several weeks, many social media users have been targeting Bill Gates, claiming he is connected to the worldwide spread of coronavirus. One such viral claim says that a research institute founded by the Microsoft co-founder created the virus. Another says he has developed a vaccine that would control and depopulate the world through a microchip.

It is clear that the viral image of the crop circle combining the symbols of coronavirus and Microsoft is doctored. Claims of a connection between Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and the pandemic are also misplaced. Till May 7 evening, the deadly coronavirus has infected more than 38.5 lakh people and killed over 2.66 lakh people globally.
