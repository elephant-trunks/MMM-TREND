A short video clip of Union Home Minister Amit Shah has gone viral with the claim that at a political rally, he said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi sleeps 24 hours for the welfare of the poor.

Several Twitter and Facebook users shared this video clip with captions like, “Modi ji sleeps for 24 hours”.

The India Today Anti-Fake News War Room ( AFWA) found the viral video was clipped and presented out of context to give it a different meaning. In the original video, Shah can be heard saying that PM Modi thinks about the welfare of the poor 24 hours a day while “Didi” (Mamta Banerjee) wonders when her nephew would become the Chief Minister. Shah made the statement while addressing a public meeting in Chapra, West Bengal, in April 2021.

AFWA probe

With the help of keywords searches, we discovered that the same video along with the same claim had made the rounds of social media in 2021 as well.

We found the original video on the official Bharatiya Janata Party YouTube channel. It was uploaded on April 17, 2021. The title of the YouTube video read, “HM Shri Amit Shah addresses public meeting in Chapra, West Bengal.”

At the 5.34-minutes mark, one can hear the unedited version of the portion of the speech that went viral.

In the original video, Shah was talking about the Trinamool Congress-led government in West Bengal. Shah said “This is a government for the welfare of the nephew... Modi ji thinks about the welfare of the poor, 24 hours a day. And Didi thinks about when her nephew will become Chief Minister, 24 hours a day.”

Instead of “sote” (sleep), Shah said “sochte” (thinks) in the original video. But the video was clipped to change the meaning of the sentence altogether.

Thus, an old clipped video of Amit Shah has gone viral with a misleading claim.
