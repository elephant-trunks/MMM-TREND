A video of the actress Urfi Javed seems to be going viral on social media. In the video, Javed can be seen walking with a suitcase. People have raised objections to her outfit and have called it skimpy. The outrage was mostly shared by male users on Twitter.

Poet and writer Javed Akhtar has also been in news recently for comparing the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to the Taliban and calling them one and the same. This comment drew lots of criticism from the right wing community resulting in a protest outside his house in Mumbai.

While various users posted this video, what each of them claimed was that Urfi Javed is the granddaughter of Javed Akhtar and shamed her for wearing this outfit. User @Atulsay went one step further and asked what punishment she would get under the Taliban regime.

Several users posted similar claims

Fact-Check:

We tried to find a link between Javed Akhtar and Urfi Javed but were unable to find any. Urfi Javed is an actress from Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Javed Akhtar has two children, namely Zoya Akhtar and Farhan Akhtar. Zoya Akhtar does not have children and Farhan Akhtar has two children namely, Shakya and Akira as witnessed here .

Apart from this false connection, the posts display a pattern of deliberate misogyny and sexism to put down Urfi for her appearance.

This claim is false and misleading.
