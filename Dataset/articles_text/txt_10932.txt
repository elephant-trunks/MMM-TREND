Fact Check-

We started our investigation by carefully observing the video where we noticed the logo of Ethiopian Airlines.

Keeping this in mind, we ran a keyword search on YouTube that led us to the same video posted on 11 March 2019. The caption of the video reads, “Ethiopia Plane Crash, Ethiopia Airlines B737 MAX Crashes after take-off, Addis Ababa Airport [XP11]” The video was created using X Plane 11 that is a computer program used to create flight simulation videos.

The description of video states that this is not what exactly happened. This is only a software simulated flight crash for Ethiopian Airline flight ET302. This video is a recreation of crash that took place in March 2019. However, the description has stated that the video does not show the exact recreation.

The viral video can be seen from 9 minutes 30 seconds on the YouTube video.

What happened to Ethiopian Airlines flight 302?

Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 was a scheduled international passenger flight from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport in Ethiopia to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, Kenya. On 10 March 2019, the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft crashed near the town of Bishoftu six minutes after take-off, killing all 157 people aboard.

Conclusion-

Fact Crescendo found the claim made along with the viral video on social media to be False. The video being shared as the recent Chinese aircraft crash is the simulation video of an Ethiopian Airlines flight that crashed in 2019.
