Spread the truth:

Congress Minister Sanjay Nirupam tweets a fake photoshopped image claiming that RSS saluted Queen of England.

Both photos are different, where the queen along with her guard has been cut and placed on RSS photo.

SMHoaxSlayer was the first in country, cleared it in February 2016 too and pleasingly came across Navbharat Times Feb article which gave credit. Oldest yet. Yes logo and colors were different then.

After SMHoaxSlayer, many others like ABP news etc ran stories on it.

Sanjay Nirupam Ji’s Verified Twitter Handle posted this Lie :

Sanghis giving guard of honour to queen in 1920..

Will give give now to Nawaz Sharif in 2020??#BiryaniWithNawaz pic.twitter.com/wExK8iZAoO — Gopi Shah (@gops333) December 25, 2015
