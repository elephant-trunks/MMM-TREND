Two disturbing images showing a man carrying a woman's body in Odisha, after breaking it from the hip and packing it in a sack due to lack of available services have resurfaced as recent, amidst the ongoing lockdown. One such viral post reads, "Modiji wants to build a self-dependent India. A son broke the dead body of his mother to fit in a bag because of the unavailability of any government service. This incident is supposed to be from Odisha." (Original caption in Hindi: #मोदी जी ऐसे #आत्मनिर्भर भारत बनाना चाहते हैं सरकारी कोई सूबीधा नेही मिलने से अपने #मां के मृतक शरीर के #हाथ पैर तोड़ कर बस्ता में घुसा के ले जा रहा है बेटा,,,यह घटना #उडीसा के बताया जा रहा है)

The incident had occurred near Soro railway station in Odisha where two men had to carry the body of an old woman after she was run over by a goods train in 2016, as reported by India Today. 80-year-old Salamani Behera's body had to be taken to the Balasore district hospital for post-mortem, but no ambulance was available as reported by the The Indian Express. An auto driver was hired, who charged a higher fare from them to carry the corpse to the district hospital. BOOM had debunked the image earlier in 2019 when it was viral.
