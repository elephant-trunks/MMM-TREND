Chief Secretary @MamataOfficial and DGP @WBPolice called on me at Raj Bhawan at 6 PM today.



Unfortunately both came without any paper or reports sought. Directed them to send the same without delay. In a sense disgusted with such stance. Hope there is appropriate response now. pic.twitter.com/RJUnCZp1VY
