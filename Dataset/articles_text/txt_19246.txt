BOOM found that the viral photo has been morphed and in the original photo the woman is not making any crude gesture to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We ran a reverse image search and found the original photo was tweeted by news agency ANI on October 21, 2021, "Prime Minister Narendra Modi gives a thumbs up to healthcare workers at Delhi's RML Hospital today morning as India crosses one billion COVID19 vaccinations." In the photo, we can spot that the woman is not making a crude gesture and just touching the glass with her hand. BOOM debunked the fake image earlier in October, 2021.
