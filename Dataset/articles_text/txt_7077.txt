A post is being widely shared on social media claiming that ‘Naresh’ had chopped off the head of ‘Rauf’ in self-defence, because of the threats he received for supporting Nupur Sharma. Let us fact-check the claim made in the post.

Claim: Nupur Sharma supporter ‘Naresh’ chopped off Rauf’s head in self-defence. Fact: There is no evidence to show that Nupur Sharma supporter ‘Naresh’ chopped off Rauf’s head in self-defence. On 21 June 2022, a pharmacist named Umesh Kolhe was murdered in Amaravati. Maharashtra. On 28 June 2022, Ghaus Mohammad and Riyaz Attari killed a Hindu tailor named Kanhaiyalal in Udaipur, Rajasthan. Both the killings happened because they had supported Nupur Sharma on social media. However, we could not find any recent reports which confirm that a supporter of Nupur Sharma beheaded someone. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.

We could not find any credible information to prove that a Nupur Sharma supporter had killed someone named ‘Rauf’ in self-defence.
