After a simple Google reverse image search, it was found that the same image was circulated back in July 2019 under the caption: “कावड यात्रा पर निकली साधुयी | रास्ते मे सोम रस पिते हुई..!! किंगफिशर ब्रांडेड … अब कोई यह मत कहना कि बियर पी रही हैं ”



The translation is as follows: “Female monks on Kanwar yatra drinking alcohol. Kingfisher brand. Come on, now don’t say that this is beer.”
