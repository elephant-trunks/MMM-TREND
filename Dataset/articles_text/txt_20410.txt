On the occasion of Ram Navami, students of ABVP got violent and demanded to take off Non-vegetarian dishes from the menu of Kaveri Hostel at JNU. Both the right-wing and left-wing students got into a heated argument over freedom on this matter.

JNU students also claimed of being attacked by ABVP members. In the midst of all this, a picture is getting trolled on Twitter of a girl. It is claimed that the injury on the girl’s head is fake and instead of blood there is sauce on her head.
