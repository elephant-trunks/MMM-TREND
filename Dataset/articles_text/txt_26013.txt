Two photos are going viral on social media about the landslide in Manipur. In the first photo, army personnel is seen on the road, while in the second many people are seen holding umbrellas.

Social Media users are claiming that these pictures are of a landslide in Manipur’s Noni district, in which nearly seven army personnel died.

A user on Facebook writes, “Sad and heart-wrenching accident Manipur – Army camp sunk in a landslide, 55 Army Jawans buried in mud debris, rescue operation continues, so far the bodies of 7 soldiers have been removed! God bless all the soldiers! A tearful tribute to the martyred soldiers! (Translates Hindi)

Fact Check:

We at DFRAC reverse searched the image on Google and found a report regarding this on the news website of FirstPost with the caption, “Nagaland: Eight Assam Rifles jawans killed, 6 injured in militant ambush.” Dated 4th May 2015.

We found other report on Hindustan Times with the headline, “Assam Rifles soldier killed, 3 injured in IED blast in Manipur’s Ukhrul.” On 15th June 2017

The second picture is from Manipur Landslides date 11th of July 2018 as per the report of India.com

Conclusion:

The viral images have nothing to do with the landslide in Manipur’s Noni district. Both photos are old.

Claim Review: the pictures are of a landslide in Manipur’s Noni district, in which nearly seven army personnel died.
