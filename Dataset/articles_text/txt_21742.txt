Since Mithun Chakraborty joined the BJP on March 7 in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kolkata, a number of Twitter accounts have cropped up in his name. These accounts have been continuously posting sarcastic comments targetting West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that Mithun has recently created a Twitter account “@mithunda_off” and is trying to get it verified. This is his only genuine Twitter account. All other accounts in his name are impersonating him.

With so many accounts claiming to be the “official Twitter account” of Mithun, netizens are left confused. Let us look into three such accounts impersonating the actor with the maximum number of followers.

Account 1: @M_Chakraborty16

Replying to a tweet by the Twitter handle “@M_Chakraborty16”, a user said this account was earlier active with the handle “@SwetaaSinghAT”.

Using this as a clue, we used “Twitter Advanced Search” to find the tweets addressed to “@SwetaaSinghAT”. This led us to a tweet in which a person addressed “@M_Chakraborty16” as “Sweta Ji”.

Account 2: @mithun_da_

Every Twitter account has a unique Twitter ID number. The handle of the Twitter account can be changed, but the Twitter ID number remains the same.

Using “TweetBeaver” tool, we found the Twitter ID number of the handle “@mithun_da_”. When we searched this ID on Yandex search engine, we found that the same account was earlier impersonating singer Sonu Nigam and was active with the handle “@Sonuniga_M”.

We also found a tweet in which a person had addressed “@mithun_da_” as “@Sonuniga_M”.

Account 3: @TheINDAshking

When we searched the Twitter ID number of the handle “@TheINDAshking”, we found that in the past, the same ID was used to create a handle “@ThechitraLive” with usernames “Aishwarya kulshreshtha”, “M. S Bitta” and “Dr. Chitra Sharma”.

We found a cached archive of the handle “@ThechitraLive” which was earlier also operational in the name of “Nita Ambani”.

Speaking to AFWA, Mithun’s manager Vijay Upadhyay confirmed that till recently, the actor did not have a social media presence. “It had recently come to my knowledge that many fake Twitter accounts are being run in the name of Mithun da. I have already informed him about this,” Upadhyay said.

We also spoke to the Bengal unit of BJP who told us that Mithun has only recently created a Twitter account “@mithunda_off” and is trying to get it verified.

“The Twitter handle @mithunda_off has been created because some people have created fake accounts in the name of Mithun Chakraborty. We are also planning to file a complaint against the Twitter accounts impersonating him,” said Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh’s personal secretary Dev.

Thus, it is clear that the Twitter accounts @M_Chakraborty16, @mithun_da_ and @TheINDAshking do not belong to actor-politician Mithun Chakraborty. His only Twitter account is “@mithunda_off”, which he created recently and is trying to get verified.
