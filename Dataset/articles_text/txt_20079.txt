A post in the name of Russian President Vladimir Putin is becoming very viral on social media. In which he said that he has asked Pakistan to vacate Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK).

The user wrote in his Facebook post that empty PoK, Pok is an integral part of India – #Vladimir_Putin_Russia means that something big is going to happen now.

Along with this, the user, while answering the question of another user in the comment, said that Putin has given this statement yesterday.

Fact Check: To check the above claim, DFRAC did some keyword searches on Google like Pakistan, Kashmir, Vladimir Putin. But there was no news from any media house regarding this.

Continuing the investigation when we searched the Kremlin’s official website for press releases related to Pakistan and Kashmir. So there was no press release about this too. So that it can be proved that Putin made no such statement.
