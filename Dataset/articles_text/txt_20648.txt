Emirates is a Dubai-based company that comes under the subsidiary of Emirates Group and it is owned by the Government of Dubai. Emirates has its headquarters in Garhoud, Dubai, UAE. The company serves 82 countries and recently a dazzling claim is going viral that Emirates has launched a new “Dimond encrusted Airplane”.

Another account named Kengist tweeted on 14th December, “The UAE has been known for its riches and flaunting of wealth. Some viral photos of a ‘diamond-encrusted airplane’ which emerged online, has turned into an internet sensation, as many wonder how Emirate airline will make a whole plane filled with diamonds.

In short- Emirates launched a Diamond encrusted Airplane that is getting viral on social media platforms.

Fact Check

. After cross-checking the news, we got a tweet by Emirates Airline on 4th December 2021 which resolves our doubts about the picture. Emirates Airlines tweeted, “Presenting the Emirates ‘Bling’ 777. Image created by Sara Shakeel”.

Sara Shakeel is a Pakistani artist who fills glittery filters on any image and in the same she did with the ‘Bling’ 777. She posted the same picture on her Instagram account and the image also got featured by the official account of Emirates on Twitter.

The sparkling image of Emirates Airplane also got in the headline by Architectural Design.

AD wrote about the background of Sara Shakeel and how wonderfully she is creating these sparkling images.

Conclusion – The news is fake and misleading as Emirates didn’t launch the diamond-encrusted airplane, it is Sara Shakeel’s filter that made it look glittery.
