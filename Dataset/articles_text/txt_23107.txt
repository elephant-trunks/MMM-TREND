It's a settled affair that controversial televangelist Zakir Naik is not returning from Malaysia anytime soon.

But will he come back to India if the guard changed in New Delhi? Social media is replete with claims that the preacher would if the Congress returned to power.

India Today has debunked the rumours designed to portray the opposition as a sympathiser of Muslim hardliners.

In his audio statement from Malaysia on Wednesday, Naik set no such condition.

He gave no timeline. Nor did he hinge his return on any governance structure in India.

"I have no plans to come back till I don't feel safe from unfair prosecution," Naik said from Malaysia. "Inshallah, when I feel that the Indian government will be just and fair, I will surely return to my homeland."

Earlier this week, images of the preacher, who is accused of inciting disaffection on religious lines, were circulated on social platforms with captions reading "Aatanki Zakir Naik Ne Kaha Congress Sarkar Aane Par Lotunga Bharat -- Matlab Congress Ka Hath Atankwadi Ke Sath?"

But in his statement, he ruled out his return from the word go.

"The news of my coming to India is baseless and totally false," said Naik, under investigation by the NIA and ED.

His NGO, the Islamic Research Foundation (IRF), was declared illegal in 2016.

The same year, IRF cast a shadow over the Congress party when reports came out that it had donated Rs 50 lakh to the Sonia Gandhi-led Rajiv Gandhi Foundation in 2011. The amount was later returned to the IRF after the damning reports.

Bangladesh also accuses Naik of the deadly Dhaka terror attack in 2016, which left more than 20 killed.

On June 20, the Bombay High Court refused any relief to Naik, saying he showed no interest or desire to cooperate with investigating agencies.
