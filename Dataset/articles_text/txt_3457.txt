Video from Last year.

This is how PETA India took away kanchi mutt elephants.

The elephant did not want to go, it jumped out of the truck, and the torture PETA did to take her away.

Now they want to take Lakshmi Elephant from Puducheri temple but Thanks to the efforts of Indu Makkal Katchi the temple has somehow managed to retain their elephant for now.

PETA has filed a PIL in Madras highcourt to take away Lakshmi From Temple authorities . BJP MP Menika Gandhi is leading this movement.

#ASK Yourself Do we really need these #Fake_Gandhis in BJP??
