A video of NRI Affairs minister of Punjab’s AAP (Aam Admi Party) Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal is getting viral on social media platforms. In the video’s short clip, Kuldeep was seen saying, “ if an NRI’s land is continuously on lease with someone, then NRI will automatically lose ownership of the land. We do not want any NRIs to lose their property through this judgment.”

The video was shared on Facebook, “these NRIs want inqlaab in Punjab. They are the ones who flew in support of Kejriwal and poured lots of money on him. This law will apply to those NRIs who support Khalistan.” Reads the caption. (translates Punjabi)
