Spread the truth:

A photo of a TV mounted on a wall is viral which shows a Photo of UP CM Yogi Adityanath and false text.

Next to UP CM’s photo, the text reads “अगर हमारी सरकार गिरी तो पुरे देश में आग लगा दूंगा – योगी आदित्यनाथ”

English Translation: “If our government falls, I’ll burn entire country – Yogi Adityanath”

Analysis

We were sent this photo on WhatsApp, on Friday. A close look cleared it to be fake. We tried to contact the channel but didn’t receive any reply yet

The Channel logo on top right was not known well. We searched YouTube for Gujarati News channel and found the logo of Manyata News matching to this

The first thing we noticed was Gujarati Fonts on the bottom bar which suggests this to be a Gujarati News channel.

On deep search i.e. checking many news videos it became clear that they use only Gujarati Language fonts, nothing in Hindi unlike the viral image

This is a screenshot from their videos

Further there were many discrepancies in the edited image, you can see the difference in color and shape of red patch below

Difference in the color of blue

You can see below the image is not in straight line, but is curved.

The photo of Yogi Adityanath used is more than 2 years old

Spelling of is “गीरी” wrong. Should be “गिरी”
