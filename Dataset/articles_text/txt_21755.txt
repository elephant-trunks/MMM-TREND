Amid the electrifying political atmosphere in West Bengal in the run-up to assembly elections, a video showing BJP workers breaking a police cordon and pelting stones and furniture at a house is circulating on social media with the claim that this is how the party is disturbing peace in the state.

Several Facebook users have posted the video with a sarcastic caption in Hindi that translates to, “If farmers are rioting in Delhi, then is BJP trying to maintain peace in Bengal?”

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is not from West Bengal but Telangana. On January 31, BJP workers attacked the house of Warangal TRS MLA Challa Dharma Reddy after he reportedly made objectionable comments on the Ram Mandir donation drive.

The actual incident

After carefully watching the video, we found a police vehicle with “Warangal Police” written on it.

Taking this as a cue, we searched the Internet using keywords and found several videos and news articles related to the incident.

A “Hindustan Times” report of February 1 published a similar image of BJP workers throwing plastic chairs at a house. As per this report, 39 BJP workers were arrested for attacking the residence of TRS MLA Challa Dharma Reddy in Warangal, Telangana.

“The News Minute” had also published a similar report on the same incident.

A video of the incident was uploaded by YouTube channel “LatestLY” on February 2 with the title, “BJP Workers Arrested For Pelting Stones, Attacking TRS MLA’s House In Warangal, Telangana”.

As per these reports, the attack took place after Reddy alleged that BJP leaders are collecting huge funds in the name of construction of the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya without showing any accounts and they are swindling the money.

Hence, it is confirmed that the video showing BJP workers ransacking a house is not from West Bengal but Telangana.
