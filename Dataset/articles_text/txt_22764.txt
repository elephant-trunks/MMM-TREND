It was a heartbreaking moment for Indian cricket fans when MS Dhoni got run out in the nail-biting semi-final against New Zealand. Now, an emotional post is viral on Internet claiming that even the cameraman on the ground couldn’t stop himself and cried on Dhoni’s dismissal.

The post has a photo collage of four images three show a crying cameraman and one is a picture of Dhoni leaving the field after his dismissal.

India Today’s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false. The man in tears is actually an Iraqi photojournalist who cried on the defeat of Iraq in the AFC Asian Cup football tournament 2019.

The misleading post spread like wildfire on social media. Online shopping portal Bewakoof.com uploaded the post on its official Facebook handle on Thursday. The post has been liked by more than 20,000 users and shared almost 1,000 times at the time of filing this story.

A simple reverse search tells the truth behind this photo. The official Twitter handle of Asian Cup posted the viral photo in January this year and identified the man as an Iraqi photographer.
