A picture of Arvind Kejriwal shaking hands with Rahul Gandhi has gone viral on social media with the claim that even after losing big, the Congress leader congratulated the Delhi chief minister with a smile.

The Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) swept the Delhi assembly election, winning 62 out of the 70 seats. The BJP secured eight seats, while the Congress drew a blank.

Facebook user "Azeem Sheikh" posted the picture along with a claim in Hindi which translates to, "This is called brotherhood. Even after a poor defeat, Rahul Gandhi is congratulating Kejriwal with a smile."

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the photo to be half true. This is an old photo, taken at Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi, on January 26, 2018.

The photo, with the misleading claim, has already been shared over 1,000 times from different Facebook profiles. The archived version of Azeem Sheikh's post can be seen here.

With the help of reverse search, we found the viral photo on "Getty Images".

Here, the caption along with the photo says then Congress president Rahul Gandhi met Kejriwal during an 'At Home' reception at Mughal Gardens in Rashtrapati Bhavan after the Republic Day parade on January 26, 2018.

We could not find any news report saying Rahul met Kejriwal after the results of the recent Delhi assembly elections were announced. However, on February 11, Rahul Gandhi did congratulate Kejriwal and AAP on Twitter on winning the Delhi elections.
