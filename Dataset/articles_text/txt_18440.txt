BOOM had debunked the video in 2019 when it was viral with false claims that it shows real fireworks at display in Mumbai's Borivali. We had then run a keywords search on YouTube and found the same video uploaded on YouTube in January, 2013 with a title, "New Years 2013 - Synchronized Epic Music (Heart of Courage) - FWSim Fireworks Display - HD". When we looked up FWSim on the internet, we found that it is a fireworks simulator website where subscribers can create their videos of fireworks through the software.
