A photo showing National Democratic Alliance (NDA)'s presidential candidate Droupadi Murmu with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) Chief Mohan Bhagwat praying in front of a photo of a Hindu goddess, is being shared on social media.

Among those who shared it was Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who was also quick to issue a correction and delete his tweet.
