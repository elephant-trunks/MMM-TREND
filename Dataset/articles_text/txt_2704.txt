BJP MLA Raja Singh supporting the beating of Dalits in Una

BJP MLA Raja Singh supports the brutal thrashing of Dalits in Una in Gujarat while they were skinning a dead cow. He calls the victims of Una "galeez" (filthy) and appreciates the Gau Rakshaks for beating them up. He also states indirectly that the violent methods adopted by Gau Rakshaks should continue. Now do we call him fringe? He's a MLA! A person who is supposed to make laws is blatantly egging on people to use violent methods.
