Heavy rains and strong winds lashed parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat as cyclone Nisarga made a landfall on Wednesday. Multiple videos and images of the same are also doing the rounds on social media.

Amid this, a 15-second video of a funnel-shaped column over a water body is going viral with the claim that this was the eye of the storm. Many social media users and news websites such as “Jio News” have shared the clip along with the erroneous claim.

News websites of the Network18 Group also fell for the hoax, though they later deleted the video.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be false as it is more than seven months old.

The caption of the video says, “#CycloneNisarga | Take a look at the eye of the storm”. The archived version can be seen here.

With the help of InVID tool, we found that the same video was uploaded by a YouTube user on October 25, 2019, with the title, “Kyarr Cyclone #karnataka”.

Kannada news channel “Suvarna News” also used the same video on the same date and titled it, “Cyclone Kyarr Batters Coastal Karnataka; Gusty Winds, Heavy Rain Hits Normal Life”.

Cyclone Kyarr was a powerful tropical cyclone that affected Maharashtra, Karnataka and Goa in October last year.

However, GP Sharma, President, Meteorology, Skymet Weather, told us that the water column seen in the video is not even a cyclone, but a waterspout, i.e. a column of rotating, cloud-filled wind that occurs over a water body.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the viral video has no relation to Cyclone Nisarga as it has been available on the Internet for more than seven months.
