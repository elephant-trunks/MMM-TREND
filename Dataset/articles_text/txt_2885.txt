Rishab Dutta, a 17-year-old from Kakopothar in Assam’s Tinsukia District, became an internet sensation in late 2019 thanks to his musical talent.

But after his death on Thursday in Bengaluru, many of his videos are being widely shared again on social media. Dutta got many followers thanks to his music while undergoing treatment first at Christian Medical College in Vellore, and later at a private hospital in Bengaluru. Friends and family of the teen regularly shared videos of him singing in his hospital room, often surrounded by the doctors and nurses who were treating him. Dutta aspired to be a professional singer.

The video was viewed nearly 4 lakh times and had over 10,000 shares in less than 16 hours.
