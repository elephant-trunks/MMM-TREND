A video is getting viral, all over the internet claiming it of the Janpad baghpat, a tehsil in Meerut district where many people are seen in aggression and using sticks to break the glass of many vehicles present there.

This is claimed that the people are angry with the BJP government and hence showing their anger and agitation through this act of violence when the BJP Leader’s Jeeps entered the village and is also claimed of recent times i.e. of January 2022.

Fact Check

Through research on various social media platforms it was found that this video is not of Janpad Baghpat , but is from Agra and also this is no agitation against The BJP Leaders, but between the supporters of two leaders from the same BJP party on 8th August 2021. On one side was chief of east block Sugreev Singh Chauhan and on the other side was minister Aridaman Singh . it is said that earlier both the BJP Leaders were said to have a great bounding but then because of the quest to get the ticket they both part their ways , and now their supporters are fighting against each other in Agra, UP .

Conclusion

From the research, we got to know that the video was not about the agitation against BJP Leader in Meerut, but is from Agra, where the supporters of the leaders from the same party are fighting against each other. Also the video is not of recent times , but of the year 2021, hence making it a misleading news.
