Amid protests in the United States over the death of George Floyd, a picture of a young couple lying on the road and kissing is going viral on social media. Several security personnel can be seen in the picture, but the couple seems to ignore the chaos around.

The claims along with the photo say it was clicked recently during protests over Floyd’s death. Twitter user “Nationalist KR” posted the picture with a sarcastic caption in Hindi which translates to, “This is how protests take place in America #ALLLIVESMATTER”.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the picture to be misleading. The photo was clicked in Vancouver, Canada, in 2011 during riots that broke out between supporters of two hockey clubs.

The picture is also being circulated on Facebook with the caption, “Photos showing two lovers, kissing during a protest in Minneapolis, Minnesota United States #This Is All of Us #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd”. The archived version can be seen here.

Using reverse image search, we found many articles on the Internet on the viral picture. As per “New York Post”, the iconic photo was taken in June 2011 when riots erupted in Canada’s Vancouver after the local ice hockey team Canucks lost to Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup final.

According to “CBC News”, the couple was identified as Canadian Alex Thomas and her Australian boyfriend Scott Jones.

In an interview to “The Guardian”, Scott had said he kissed Alex to calm her down as she was knocked over by a mob and was getting hysterical.

The picture, clicked by photographer Rich Lam, had then become the talk of the town.

Hence, it can be concluded that the viral post is misleading as the picture is nine years old and from Canada. It has nothing to do with protests that erupted after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, United States.
