A video was shared on social media showing a man adding what looks like toilet cleaner to a container supposedly full of “pani puri” water. Those sharing the video claimed that the man in the video, whose face was covered, was Muslim. Some even claimed that his name was Zubair.

AFWA’s investigation found that this video was staged. It was created by a Facebook page called “Gyan Bhandar” that had issued a disclaimer that this video was made to spread awareness.
