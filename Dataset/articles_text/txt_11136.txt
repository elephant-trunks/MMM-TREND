The report states that Israeli warplanes carried out airstrikes on different parts of the blockaded Gaza Strip. According to the report 41 Palestinians were injured in the demonstrations held at the border of the blockaded Gaza Strip. These blasts took place during a protest to organised to commemorate the 52nd anniversary of the burning of the Masjid Al-Aqsa by a fanatical Jew in 1969.
