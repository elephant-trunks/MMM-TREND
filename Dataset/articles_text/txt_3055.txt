As rains batter several parts of Pakistan, leaving over 180 people dead already, a video of a cloud burst is being widely shared on social media with a claim that the visuals are from Pakistan’s Karachi.

The video is being shared on Facebook with a caption in Urdu: بریکنگ نیوز “.کراچی میں آج بادل پھٹنے کا منظر

(Translation: BREAKING NEWS…Scene of cloudburst in Karachi today)

Here’s the link to the above post.

FACT CHECK

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim and found it to be MISLEADING.

Using the InVid Tool, we extracted keyframes from the viral video and performed a Reverse Image Search. This search directed us to a YouTube channel that carried the same viral video on July 21, 2019, with the caption, “A time-lapse of multiple microbursts falling just north of Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona on August 23, 2018.”

We checked the website of Kyle Benne, who uploaded the video on his YouTube channel. We found that the same video was also uploaded on his website with the same caption.

Searching further, we found similar visuals uploaded on Alamy.com with the caption, “Microburst Over Phoenix, Arizona.” The image was uploaded on August 23, 2018.

Though we could not ascertain the exact date of the video, it can be concluded that the viral video is from the USA and not Pakistan. Therefore, the viral claim is misleading.
