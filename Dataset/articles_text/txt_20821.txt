Amidst the ongoing communal violence in Tripura, many videos and images have been circulating online to show just what is happening in the state. However, amongst these posts there is a lot of misinformation and fake news as well. On October 28, users began posting videos of a massive procession stating that this rally was taking place in Kadamtala, Tripura to protest against the violence.

Fact-Check:

Upon performing a key word and key frame search on the video, we found that the same footage was posted in May,2021. The procession was actually a funeral procession Hazrat Abdul Hameed Mohammad Salimul Qadri in Badaun, Uttar Pradesh taken out on May 9 ,2021.

Here is the original video:
