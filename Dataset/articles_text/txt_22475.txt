The BJP’s drubbing in the Delhi Assembly elections has left the state BJP chief, Manoj Tiwari, red-faced.

According to a media report, Tiwari even offered to resign from his position, taking the responsibility of the party’s defeat.

But did Tiwari break into tears in an interview to a TV news channel after the exit poll results?

Several Facebook users such as 'Zaid Imam' and 'Md Ayaz Khan' posted a video of Tiwari’s interview where the emotional Delhi BJP chief can be seen in tears.

User Ayaz Khan has written the caption in Hindi: Exit poll pe hansi aati hai ab rona aa raha hai.

The archived version of the post can be seen here and here.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this to be a misleading claim. This particular interview of Tiwari happened nearly a month ago, much before the exit poll. Tiwari, in this interview, got emotional about his humble upbringing.

The viral video shows that Tiwari was giving an interview to the TV9 news channel as one can see the channel logo on the mic held by the reporter.

Searching on YouTube, we found the exact interview uploaded by TV9 Bharatvarsh on January 14, 2020. The caption of the interview says besides giving challenge to Kejriwal, listen why Manoj Tiwari became emotional in this exclusive interview given to TV9 correspondent Abhishek Upadhyay.

When the correspondent asked Tiwari about his family and upbringing, the Delhi BJP chief broke into tears while giving details about his struggle in the early years.

Hence, it is clear that Manoj Tiwari cried on TV but it wasn't on the day of exit poll results. The viral video is nearly a month old.
