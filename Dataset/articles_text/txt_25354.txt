Spread the truth:

Did PM Modi say “7 lakh villages in Karnataka” ? Many verified twitter handles are calling PM Modi wrong with facts but the irony is, they themselves missed the fact in the first place. A News channel “News 9” flashed “7 Lakh villages” on their screen, critics were fast to take photo of it and then it all begin –

It all started from this wrong news.

According to Modiji, there are 7 lakh unelectrified villages in Karnataka. Just so that he knows, there are 6,40,867 villages in India. Not the first time @PMOIndia caught peddling misinformation. Thanks Dr Singh for pointing this out. https://t.co/N9WOyzAC8F — Pawan Khera (@Pawankhera) February 5, 2018

There are 6,40,867 villages in entire India, let alone Karnataka; 80% of these were electrified by 2014. An example of deliberate lies by PM Modi in election rallies. pic.twitter.com/NadqaJTQhk — Gaurav Pandhi (@GauravPandhi) February 5, 2018

Total population of India 135 cr.

600 cr voted #BJP.

While Mr. Modi goes to Karnataka to lament about "7 lakh" imaginary villages that are without electricity, his appointed VC @mamidala90 disconnects the lights at Sabarmati bus stop where students are protesting, putting them at risk of being hurt by speeding vehicles!! How Petty! https://t.co/ZD0wLQA9oI — Shehla Rashid (@Shehla_Rashid) February 5, 2018

The figure of 7 lac villages may be PM’s masterstroke to get attention to electrification problem in Karnataka but BJP is 100% committed to 100% electrification .. in fact they commit themselves to it each year !! 😆 😝 pic.twitter.com/qg2V9BaFGc — Arvind Jha (@jalajboy) February 8, 2018

Modi claims that 7 lakh villages in Karnataka have not been electrified yet, whereas, entire India has only 6,40,867 villages and 80% of these were already electrified by 2014. Didn't I tell you that this guy knows nothing about India other than dividing and rioting? pic.twitter.com/wWN6FpVZQQ — Kiran Kumar (@Yr_Conscience) February 5, 2018

Not surprising. He talked this also! 1) India's population is 600 Cr. 2) Pakoda selling is an employment assisted by Government. 3) 700000 Villages in Karnataka are unelectrified despite India having 6,40,867 Villages. — भारत परभाणे (@parbhane) February 8, 2018
